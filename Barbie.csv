"Beautiful film, but so preachyLoveofLegacy21 July 2023Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.1,190 out of 1,646 found this helpful.

"Clever and fun beginning turns into another lecture in the patriarchyBinkconn21 July 2023Barbie begins in an irresistible way, as a fun dismantling of all the plasticized and body image ideals the doll has set for little girls throughout the decades, as Barbie faces an existential crisis and must journey into the real world to find her true self. Then about halfway through America Ferrera shows up as a dissatisfied Barbie designer and starts hammering us about the patriarchy, as if all men were clueless, macho oafs like Ken that needed to be smugly tolerated by the greater hierarchy of women. Gerwig seems to be projecting her issues about Hollywood and it makes Barbie out of touch.804 out of 1,173 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

"A Technicolor Dreamheatherhilgers24 July 2023Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.20 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9

"Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!HabibieHakim12319 July 20238.5 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.535 out of 1,231 found this helpful.

"Fun and surprisingly touchingjpismyname19 July 2023I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.416 out of 965 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"High Highs, Low Lows.Lk199024 July 2023The first thing you need to know about Barbie is that Ryan Gosling is the best part of the entire film. For the duration he is over the top, dumb and hilarious. Every scene he was in had me laughing and I enjoyed just about everything he did in the film.Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie and as usual puts in a fantastic performance. She hit pretty much every mark in my opinion and I can't see anyone taking her place in this role.Where the film falls flat unfortunately is not the characters, actors or even humour for that matter. It's the incessant political lecturing.It's no surprise that this film takes a strong feminist angle. That's to expected. Barbie was a doll that portrayed many different professions in an attempt to show young girls that they could strive for me than what they were told they could do. But that was the 1950s. This is 2023.By no means is the world a perfect representation of equality today, but it is so vastly superior in that category than it ever has been that the theme of the film falls a little flat. Telling young girls to go after their dreams and not be beholden to any stereotypes is a positive, wonderful message and one that could've been portrayed so much better. But instead, the film teeters on the edge of a radical feminist position.I've seen a lot of people say the film hates men. I disagree with this. I don't think it hates men. Instead, it takes a very simplistic, black and white view of Western culture and assumes that women's lives are overall difficult and men's lives are overall quite easy. When in reality, life is tough. For everyone. At least 99% of us. Claiming otherwise is unjust.However, it's not just the political stance it takes that brings the film down. It's how incessant it is. They are without any shame pushing a political message through the screen down your throat every 10 minutes. It's unbearable at times. Going to the cinema or watching a film should be an enjoyable experience, not a lecture.This film could've been beloved by all genders and ages. Both men and women love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This feels like an easy lay up for the filmmakers but by going the political route they end up having many jokes go over kids heads and alienate many of the people who where genuinely excited to see this film.I give it a 6 because of Gosling and most of the humour. It was enjoyable overall. I think Hollywood needs to stop employing multi millionaire actors to lecture the general public on how to live. It's embarrassing.236 out of 339 found this helpful.

"Well this really did come as a surprise.Sleepin_Dragon21 July 2023It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8.140 out of 324 found this helpful.

"Ken out of tenfinnconnelly-6301722 July 2023Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.364 out of 768 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"""Barbie"" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialismandypaps10119 July 2023I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.472 out of 1,096 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"It could have been so much better...hamsterination19 July 2023The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.455 out of 729 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.274 out of 611 found this helpful.

"Honestly - not funny and light enoughimdbmovieguy21 July 2023I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was very upbeat, positive and light. However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the ""conflict"" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict.358 out of 799 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"You are KenoughGenti2520 July 2023This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.164 out of 451 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.Revuer22323 July 2023The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.47 out of 75 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

"The best version of itselfmasonsaul21 July 2023Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.131 out of 415 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Creative but preachy and confusingImshortok0623 July 2023I'm just going to get straight to the point: I liked some aspects of this movie and disliked other parts. Cinematography: awesome. Choreographed musical numbers: hilarious. Comedy: good. Margot Robbie: great. Ryan Gosling: awesome, and arguably the best part of the movie. The scenery and props really did help create the world. The storyline started off very intriguing. However, when the movie got to the meat of the plot and the central conflict, its message became confusing. It's like they wanted to make Ken the bad guy yet also sympathetic, which is not impossible or unheard of, but the way the writers did this was ineffective. Also, the resolution didn't make sense based on the message and events that led up to it. Lastly, I really hate it when movies try to empower women by dumbing down the men. I get that in a Barbie world, Ken is an afterthought, but in the real world all men were also dumb. They also treated masculine qualities as ""evil."" I hate stereotyping people, men included, and it's like all men ride horses and have fragile egos and drink ""brewskies."" And for goodness sake, if I had a dollar for every time the movie said ""patriarchy"", I'd be rich. So, overall, I give this movie a 6.1,007 out of 1,363 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I am Kenougheoinageary23 July 2023So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8.53 out of 139 found this helpful.

"It's like G.I Joe...For girls! Seriously, and I love it for that!subxerogravity23 July 2023I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a ""BarbieLand"" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in. The film just looks really good.Give praise to director Greta Gerwig because this movie is fun but there were a lot of deep life cuts and the balance between the two was perfect.It was good hands down.19 out of 59 found this helpful.

"No Directionandermic1821 July 2023The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.106 out of 178 found this helpful.

"A wholesome delight!Anurag-Shetty23 July 2023Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) & his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.Barbie is a phenomenal film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a movie that is a tribute to everyone who used to play with Barbie dolls during their childhood, while also making fun of all the tropes of Barbie dolls & Ken dolls. This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up & a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha. Will Ferrell is hysterical as the Mattel CEO. Michael Cera is perfect as Allan. Helen Mirren is epic as the Narrator. The supporting cast is superb. Barbie is a must watch for a burst of childhood nostalgia & fans of Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling. Wear a bright pink shirt, grab your friends, head to your nearest theatre, watch it on the big screen & have an absolute whale of a time!30 out of 99 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Strong Start... and That's Itlokicola24 July 2023I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?40 out of 62 found this helpful.

"Not so unique as expecteddreopdreef19 July 2023The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth.101 out of 178 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

"A colorful love letter to human kindmavigangi20 July 2023I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.268 out of 766 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"We're All Dollsklastaitas28 July 2023Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?And more importantly where would we find ourselves?In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"Fun film whose script falls in on itselfmark-217-30703319 July 2023Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.236 out of 390 found this helpful.

"What A Film! I Was Ecstatic About Seeing Barbie And It Definitely Exceeded My Expectations By Far.rannynm21 July 2023What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

"Quite disappointingarslanmanzoor12321 July 2023Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.141 out of 243 found this helpful.

"!!!!!!!meltingmel21 July 2023Wow. WOW!!!!My favorite movie of all time is Aliens. It's been my favorite movie since I was 5-years-old. I'm 38 now. That has NEVER changed.Until THIS.And I bet you are thinking this review is satire. It's NOT.I'm BLOWN away. Barbie is now my favorite movie of all time - successfully unseating Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I never thought I would see the day.The movie makes you think it's going to be just a fun, silly movie to mock. NO. It's not. It's brilliantly written. It's written so well that all the adult messaging goes right over the little kids heads but still gives them plenty of enjoyment.The movie sparked really great discussion with my daughter who is 8-years-old. We discussed why it's so important to value ourselves and what the patriarchy is. It's just... mind blowingly good.And also - a good reminder to all women. WE ARE ENOUGH. We are good enough. And we need to raise our daughters to be confident and leaders if that's the path they choose.64 out of 241 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"A lot like the Lego Movie - and there's a lot to likeVic_max29 July 2023As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.It's amazing to think that, a few years back, Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role. Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It's a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations. Enjoy this experience with a big audience and you'll be glad you did.7 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"It's really something different and that's a good thingthreenails1020 July 2023It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.66 out of 262 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A triumphPedroPires9020 July 2023I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.44 out of 204 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"A really fun timeacdc_mp323 July 2023Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It's truly a good time.32 out of 131 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Expected more from Greta GerwigJPARM-IMDb26 July 2023Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to get around multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.16 out of 24 found this helpful.

"Barbie rocks!donmurray2927 July 2023Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"More of a marketing flickshadowtramp22 July 2023The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5 It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.123 out of 166 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!bm23019922 July 2023When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.62 out of 236 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Had me smiling all the way througha-hilton23 July 2023Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.21 out of 66 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Surprisingly goodJeremy_Urquhart23 July 2023I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.10 out of 36 found this helpful.

"It was good but far too preachyterryforma24 July 2023I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.34 out of 49 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Positively surprisedRalifax19 July 2023Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.I also want to highlight the makeup, set, photography and choreography. Top-notch, flawless.The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles. I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film, and I left the cinema positively surprised.122 out of 392 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I'm a middle aged man with daughters. I liked it.mr_sharma27 July 2023I suspect this is a personal thing. Who you are defines what you may get from this.Me - I'm well into my mid life (had my crisis already thank you). I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment.2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Unexpectedly good!frisoflorentinus19 July 2023I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.100 out of 350 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"This movie tries to be too muchbrianjohnson-2004324 July 2023I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.45 out of 62 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"More Than Meets The Eyebankofmarquis21 July 2023The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.30 out of 136 found this helpful.

"Barbie has an existential crisisNo-Life-10122 July 2023Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!31 out of 128 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Decent but not my typewelhof124 July 2023I'm a man in his 40's and I know I'm clearly not their target demographic. I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.The sets were all very very well done. They put a lot of time into them. The acting was awful, but awful on purpose? I'm not sure. The plot was confusing at times. I wasn't sure what that big battle was for. Why were they fighting? No reason or lead up to it was there.I really enjoyed the scenes when they were in the real world. They did good with the 'fish out of water' thing. I laughed a couple times.The sexual innuendos were there and I thought they were funny but thankfully my girlfriends daughters did not understand them.I would say a 11-13 year old girl would enjoy this.4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Barbie is not a simple live action of a timeless dollnethy-nho23 July 2023But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.13 out of 49 found this helpful.

"Best for Ryan Gosling Gives a really great performance actingmckai-8954619 July 2023I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.Especially if anyone is a Barbie fan, let me tell you, this event is very satisfying.Even I'm not looking fun. And in the movie part, it's bad comedy and teasing yourself (Warner) quite a bit .. You have to go and see for yourself and you will definitely laugh.Ryan Gosling's acting is so good, I'm sure there's a lot of laughs out there during filming.This is another very good performance for this man.What the movie does is like imagination that doesn't have to care about logic. Let's just say the story is like we're playing with dolls and assuming the role of that character...126 out of 367 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"A Hot Pink Messaherdofbeautifulwildponies26 July 2023Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken () comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of or . Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha () cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.10 out of 19 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Now I am become Barbie Girl, the enjoyer of Barbie worldscmdown-5050629 July 2023I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.3 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"The clash of the decadezebthered26 July 2023Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again.4 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Way too preachygianthaole23 July 2023My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible.28 out of 36 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4
"Greta Gerwig MasterpieceA7medSalah19 July 2023A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.87 out of 347 found this helpful.

"Exceeds Expectationsasayed-6312123 July 2023If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.15 out of 49 found this helpful.

"So fun and charming!mafiagirl-2143123 July 2023So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful ! ( which we knew from the trailers )Now before you say anything... no, this movie doesn't hate men, if anything it understands men's struggles just as much as women's, i was scared that the movie whould demonizes(?) Ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from, with him always being in Barbie's shadows and all thatSpeaking of Barbie, Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action Barbie, and look, i'm not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now... it's the one i liked the most.18 out of 65 found this helpful.

"Good but not for under 12'sedwardrevans28 July 2023I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that. You could honestly say this is a movie for feminists, now thats not a bad thing as I saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with Barbie when she was young (she's 23 now) .This movie has it's moments of comedy and is well done especially when in the Barbie world and has been well thought out and written. Cast very well as the two leads carry the movie and i'm sure there will be a sequel. But remember this is not a KIDS movie.3 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"She's everything! He's just Ken.Reviews2u29 July 2023Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!5 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Just a little emptyagjbull23 July 2023I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.15 out of 22 found this helpful.

"Barbie is On Her Way to the OscarsMini13519 July 2023When I first knew there was a Barbie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""... When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher. Then, when I saw the cast, my expectations were even higher!I went to watch this movie in the premiere and I can assure you this movie is a masterpiece.It's purposely not realistic, has an excellent director and an excellent production and story.There are lots of fun moments, but this movie is a satire to the life of Barbie.The fact that compares the dream life of Barbie to the real life in the real world it's fantastic. It's a never seen thing. It compares the women's mistreatment, the real tragedy's... it's a real good idea... Everything in this movie is really good. Go watch this movie.

"It's alrightcaptainsermig21 July 2023""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all"" And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.Solid 6, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.40 out of 69 found this helpful.

"Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertainSureCommaNot25 July 2023In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.16 out of 20 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"There is an art-house movie under all that pinkbjacob21 July 2023I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect façade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank. However it happened, chapeau. I am glad I went, I'll buy the dvd as well. I can see myself rewatching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning, but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up.19 out of 76 found this helpful.

"A darkly satirical look at gender structure in societyMrDHWong21 July 2023""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9.26 out of 134 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Great acting but why this movie?moriumemoltre20 July 2023I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.42 out of 76 found this helpful.

"Drop the kids at Oppenheimer the adults can see a real, philosophical masterpieceNewgenW19 July 2023I'm not someone who often watches comedies, so they don't make me laugh much, but if they all became as funny as Barbie, I might give it another go.Because I really laughed out loud during the film.It did away perfectly with the comedy and the moralizing, a bit deeper, philosophical stuff.Of course, the soundtrack is top-notch, the sets are breathtaking and there's Ryan Gosling: the main reason I came.In addition to all that, this film is a good critic of patriarchal rule, without overdoing it. It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism. Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society, to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality.Ok whatever, go and see it, it's worth it.83 out of 324 found this helpful.

"Overhyped movie, had its moments thoughhyllus-0126223 July 2023The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.32 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Greta shows real power of woman in BarbieGusherPop21 July 2023Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.30 out of 170 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"I'll beach you off so hardFeastMode20 July 2023I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn't feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It's the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for ""dude movies."" Something you're more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she's a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That's not me. The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys.(1 viewing, early fan screening UltraScreen 7/19/2023)33 out of 104 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Creatively Brilliantlisacarlson5022 July 2023Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!13 out of 51 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Better than I thought.dweston-3866928 July 2023Whilst not being a particular fan of (overly kooky) writer/actor/director Greta Gerwig or the recent efforts of her husband and Co writer Noah Bambaugh, this surprised me as a sharp and hugely enjoyable Toy Story/Trueman Show mash up, that will appeal to most families.Margot Robbie is excellent in the lead, much better than the over caffeine performance she gave in Babylon this year, she shows great heart and soul with good comic timing.As does Ryan Gosling, who like Colin Farrell can actually do comedy. He isn't afraid of showing himself up.It's well written and has something to say. It's also well shot and designed.Even Will Ferrell is good, though he's in a supporting role, so that helps!Out of all the summer blockbusters this year, this is the winner- and yes it's better than Oppenheimer!I could watch it again, something I couldn't do with aforementioned film.1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.anniebleasdale-9770823 July 2023Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!41 out of 116 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"It's not what you think.willsfamily1129 July 2023I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Boring Moviesriya-7687019 July 2023Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie. You will get to know about lot of Barbie you didnt know about.There will be moments where you'll be like whats going on? Why am i here ? Why didn't i book the tickets for oppenheimer early but this too shall pass.71 out of 118 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Refreshing and Creative, More Than Just a GimmickDan_W_Reviews21 July 2023Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic doll's world. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.The production design is a standout feature, a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink-themed universe. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive, skilfully capturing both the character's earnestness and humour. Her performance, combined with Greta Gerwig's skilful directing, makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.Throughout the film, I found myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents. The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions, resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience.While the film's intentions are commendable, there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply, leaving me slightly wanting more. Nonetheless, Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride, filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the year's best comedies so far.In the end, Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick, showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must-see for anyone seeking a smart, humorous, and visually arresting cinematic adventure.26 out of 128 found this helpful.

"ABUSE OF THE BARBIEsilvangigerstudio25 July 2023Here's the thing.In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.7 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

"You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗iamianiman20 July 2023Only Greta Gerwig can pull this movie off. She is the only one that can helm this movie right. No other directors can do what she did for this movie. Why? Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka 'just another commercial blockbuster movie'. Greta Gerwig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction, venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go.Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things. Some of them include patriarchy, male-dominated world, female-dominated world, perfectionism, teenage-phase life, adulting, gender equality, equity, sexual objectifications amongst many others. Now, you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film. A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff? YES. This is Greta's X-Factor, having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences. And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table.Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film. You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗25 out of 126 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Well played.PK_7119 July 2023For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played.41 out of 125 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Didn't meet my expectationsolelmao21 July 2023I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(It was nothing that hasn't been done before. It didn't really say anything. I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed. Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times.204 out of 308 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4
"La Vie en Rosedromasca22 July 2023I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbieland. Actually, I should use the plural, but I don't really know how, because it's not just about the blonde doll we all know, but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades - blondes and brunettes, with white, yellow, black or other skin colors, thinner or bigger. The multiple Barbies have the most diverse professions, from doctor to Nobel laureate writer, from astronaut to president of the United States. Ultimately, the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self-confidence to little girls and instill in them the idea that anything is possible. There are also boys, they are generally called Ken, but their purpose is to be the Barbies' (asexual) partners when those are willing to pay attention to them. The introduction to the film is excellent, with a quote from Kubrick's 'A Space Odyssey' and voiceovers narrated by Helen Mirren. When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble, the source is in the real world. Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable. The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbieland that will not necessarily be in the right direction. The awakening to reality or, if you will, the humanization of Barbie comes at a price.'Barbie' - the movie works well most of the time, especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment. The production is excellent. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations, and in some categories 'Barbie' may be the winner. The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the 70s and 80s. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldn't be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces (if they haven't already). The messages are well-punched and come across the screen quite well - genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society's conception of the place, role and appearance of women, the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society, corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed. All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film, when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously, or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I found forced and didactic. 'Barbie' was worth seeing for the fun part, for the colours, music and humour. When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious.11 out of 63 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Another Greta masterpiecehilly-9787619 July 2023Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken.171 out of 522 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played .12 out of 21 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Give Greta more than Nolan everydayRainbowVic21 July 2023There is first in every thing.And there's the first on a new thing.Greta Gerwig has never disappointed me. Even when she was at her point with the mumblecore genre. Now she bring her class and weirdness to a new top level.With Barbie Greta make the viewers never distracted but confused, in such a glam and fun colorful wave.Greta has done perfectly the accuracy and portrayal of certain dolls and places in Barbie's fabulous and magic world. Additionally, the pacing and storytelling choices feeling that it may bring directly in your cinemas the wonderful, fun, witty and very magic world that is the one of Barbie.45 out of 294 found this helpful.

Bright Pink Funbo_w27 July 2023Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.See Barbie!2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,7
"A Flamboyantly Doll-lightful AdventureMisterJxroen21 July 2023My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" (2023) with me, and ""wow"" am I glad we went. It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty, while also conveying influential messages for- and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be, no matter who you are.This film is colorful and 'alive', making it a joy to view upon. The set pieces, especially in Barbieland, are brilliant- and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real-life Barbieland set. Did they?!The acting was brilliant from everyone; you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set. Margot Robbie carried this film for sure, as one can come to expect from this modern superstar. It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character. He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor. From what I've seen in interviews, Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it.I usually despise singing and dancing in movies, but in this film it put a smile on my face. Not just because it was amusing to watch, but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts. It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well.I highly recommend everyone to go see this film, though maybe don't watch it directly before or after ""Oppenheimer"" in case you're following the current trend. Let both films sink in for a bit because they each deserve the attention.23 out of 111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second oneDello_25 July 2023I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity: * some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!29 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Actually Supports Men and WomenFireJach22 July 2023This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...I believe the movie told a full of heart story how both sides (men and women) should team work more! The story perfectly told in a satirical way explains in what areas we all struggle. I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything. It represents people lost in the world, trying to find their place and I think it says: Chill out.Don't be mad. Go there with open heart and mind and have fun because I did. Ryan Gosling was fantastic.22 out of 79 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Good but not that good.ilikelickingeyeballs23 July 2023The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a ""woke"" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!7 out of 13 found this helpful.

"The Most Moving Film I've Ever Seennicholaskutzin23 July 2023I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much, I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie ""man-hating,"" you could not be more wrong. If you think that, then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie. I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed onto women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing. Just because it did that, does not make it man-hating, especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed onto men and their emotions.Now, onto why I really loved this movie. First off, it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points. I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance. Yes, she had great comedic timing, but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling. Not only that, but the costumes and sets were immaculate. It was not only well written and acted, but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew. Each character, even despite their limited screen time, was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other.This movie made me think so much. I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a review because I had so many thoughts. I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times, but I am so glad it wasn't, because if it was, it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me. The writers and directors could have taken a more silly, childish approach, but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place, and I have to commend that.Overall, the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who hasn't yet to go watch it, especially if you have an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart. As of right now, my rating is a 9, but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again. I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world.11 out of 48 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Cute but shallowsteveinadelaide24 July 2023So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow.3 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Life in Plastic It's Fantasticrexmatthewj21 July 2023Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society. It is a film that can appeal to a wide range of audiences, from fans of Barbie to fans of comedy to fans of cinema. It is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen. Give Gosling the Oscar AND the Grammy!12 out of 63 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"It was pretty good but not worthy of the hypedaniel-smits-0317921 July 2023Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7.12 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"SO SO SO GOODlulubelle-3849322 July 2023I loved this movie so much. It's so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!10 out of 24 found this helpful.

"Good...not greatplanktonrules29 July 2023""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Did I watch the same movie as everyone else loljacobarch23 July 2023While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.109 out of 165 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Welcome to the Dollhouseaciessi25 July 2023Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years. But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut.Barbie is a risky and courageous new movie. This is a film that will be discussed and talked about for years to come. Greta Gerwig takes Matel's historic creation, every triumph and failure in its catalogue, and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman. If I could compare it to another movie, I would say it's very reminiscent of Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle. It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the film's creative team and Matel, who is also one the targets of the film's purposeful ire. It is one thing to have completed this film, and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release. Gerwig's bet is paying off big time, and you have to admit, that takes a lot of guts.Concept alone certainly isn't the film's only strength. The film is beautiful to look at. The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real-life Barbie paradise. Respectively, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension. I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbieland, Ruth Handler. Gerwig and Baumbauch's screenplay is biting and irreverent, and by the end, nobody is left unscathed. But equally so, I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land. The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord, complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty-eyed.Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer, it's safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever. After three years of streaming, it can't be overstated how wonderful that is.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"This is an mportant movie, hilarious, joyful and profoundtodorstef19 July 2023It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hypeI hope I don't dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin's ""Berlin Childhood"". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing ""realty"". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than ""The Matrix"", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer ""blue pill vs red pill"" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, ""imagenary"" and ""real*, creating the conjoined ""third realm"" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: ""we need a third pill"", so here it is.At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social & existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It's fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it. And In the end, it gives the right amount of optimism.67 out of 250 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Barbie is fun, but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice.saadhasan-3660923 July 2023Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.12 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"A nostalgic trip to our feelingsanabeatriz-8574122 July 2023Barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way (you have to think fast between laughs), amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs. We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her. Oscar winners here we go.11 out of 21 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Gerwig must have wielded a pen that igniteskasserlannister20 July 2023Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.It wasn't a surprise Margot Robbie could kill this role and make us all believe she was born for this because she was. She is my favorite actress after all. She led the film as perfectly as her Barbie but it was Ryan Gosling that took me by surprise with how much he embodied kenergy that came so explosive like some atomic bomb designed by some civilian scientist (pun intended). Then there's America Ferrera (watch our for the scenes that earned her the ""heart of the film"" ribbon) and the scene Billie Eilish's ""What Was I Made For"" was made for. (If I were to predict with all confidence who's bagging an Oscar nomination? It's Billie for Original Song.)Barbie indeed subverted expectations and stereotypes. And I hate that it worked, that's why I loved it.20 out of 121 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watchkevin_robbins21 July 2023Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7 and strongly recommend it.15 out of 68 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"I didn't like it - but it was still a masterpiecesrgymrat3327 July 2023This movie was an aesthetic dream . Just looking at it was a treat . Scene to scene , color schemes , outfit choices . This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking - even if you didn't like anything else - the straight up visual was worth it .The satire and political commentary was absolutely on point . This movie didn't try to hide what it was or what it was doing - it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that . There was nothing put in by accident - everything was thoughtful and served a purpose . This was true for every joke , every clothing choice , every character , every emotion ,The humor was funny - but this was my one complaint . I don't like crude humor and I am a prude and honestly some of it was crass . Nothing ""bad"" and I recognize I am a grinch in that way - I laughed but this was the reason I would not watch it over and over , just don't value that type of joke . But I recognize and respect the writing and it was very important to the movie .The casting and acting - INCREDIBLE! I mean really - every single person was better than the next . Margot Robbie was absolutely incredible . Every single supporting cast member was so well casted and acted . America Ferrara was amazing and her monologue was probably the highlight of the film and the most powerful part - every woman ( every person ) can relate in some way if not all ways .Hats off to Greta for this film - she took and assignment and got an A+ and then earned some extra credit - one of the great directors .Great film - and I respect it so much as a film - doesn't mean I have to love watching it ( that's what for me makes it an 8 instead of a 10, but honestly it probably deserves an 11)IGo see it - it's absolutely worth it.5 out of 24 found this helpful.

"An Elf-like work of art.shaymalloy23 July 2023My husband asked me to compare this to something else to ally, and my first thought was Elf. In these ways it lives up to one of the greatest movies of all time - both are hilarious, have wonderful musical numbers, heartwarming, will make you tear up, complicated parental storylines, unlikely character bonding, and whimsical visual tie-ins/world-building + bonus of both having Will Ferrel to boot.I loved the soundtrack - the Lizzo song being a fun 4th wallesque/narrator-y way to introduce Barbieland.The pace was even - I never felt it was moving too quickly or wanting a scene to wrap up.Some more unexpected show-stealers were Simu Liu and Arianna Greenblatt.The haters are simply mad this is a film that is self-aware and for a new generation.9 out of 37 found this helpful.

"Clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherentbobyule26 July 2023On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made to about two-thirds of the way through.3 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
Such a fun filmStuDeb226 July 2023I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.The way people have embraced it is amazing. People dressing up to go and see it. It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across. But it's a film I think will be doing the rounds for a long time with the likes of Mamma Mia.5 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8

"Barbie - Unspeakably Badjonathanruano21 July 2023I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me.73 out of 117 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2
"Be what you want to beMateo-EGC20 July 2023Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.I understood the message very well, it's great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a ""pretty"" person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live. And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the ""Just Ken Exclusive"" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!! And don't forget that you can be whatever you want to be.By the way, I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand.12 out of 73 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"WonderfulMFC921 July 2023Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9.10 out of 69 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"It swings, and it kinda hits. Kinda.drawlife22 July 2023BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6.4 out of 11 found this helpful.

"Much more than I expectedbojanasormaz20 July 2023I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.54 out of 177 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie - A Comedy Film with Something to SayPicturesinflow28 July 2023Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment. The story centers on our titular character, Barbie, in her world full of pink, numerous other Barbies and Kens, unique rules, and a repetitive daily routine. The movie overflows with laughter, clever remarks, musical numbers, dazzling sets, existential crises, and much more.Margot Robbie, portraying Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, playing Ken, thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest. As the main character in her world, Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention. She must adhere to the ""Stereotypical Barbie"" image with flawless perfection, which can become exhausting over time. On the other hand, Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public, and with his dry humor, he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film, showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie.Director Greta Gerwig, known for her unique storytelling, showcases her creativity once again in Barbie. The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations, enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it. The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world.The bold choice of including a reference to '2001: A Space Odyssey' before the actual start sets an enthralling mood. The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone, with the repeating day trope, but gradually reveals something amiss. These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision.Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages, especially towards the end, but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line. As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in 1959, certain types of comments were inevitable. The movie addresses these issues with eloquence, all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world.The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant. Pairing it with Oppenheimer, a drastically different film, for a double feature is a stroke of genius. Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie, followed by the thought-provoking story of Oppenheimer. The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results, as many attendees opted for both screenings, turning it into a global film festival with two back-to-back films.The production design, as showcased in the dazzling trailers, is impeccable, packed with intricate details, easter eggs, various era Barbies and Kens, and more. The commitment put into curating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable.Barbie arrives at an interesting time, with both writers and actors on strike, and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure. However, the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies. Barbie delivers abundant laughter, lively music, outstanding performances, and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey.1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie existentialism.jp_9124 July 2023Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.4 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Falls short of greatnessmpavaonunes22 July 2023Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.10 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Exceeded all expectations!alicianora21 July 2023Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!12 out of 64 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Loved The Barbie Doll As A kid, Loved The Barbie Movie As An AdultSAMTHEBESTEST21 July 2023Barbie (2023) : Movie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6*10 out of 47 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

"I hated Barbie. Now there is the film poster in my room.JonnaGranger21 July 2023I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.Barbie lives her happy life in Barbieland, but as she develops a human consciousness, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality.This movie is so much more than just funny, as it is political and not predictable. It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls: It criticizes Barbie's stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves.""Because Barbie can be anything, girls can be anything"" is said throughout the film. As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers, this is true.Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is. That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie, as you take her seriously and sympathize with her. Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting. He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud.All in all, ""Barbie"" differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now, as it is refreshingly new, funny and surprising. Director and author Greta Gerwig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie.18 out of 96 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"A fantastic satirical drama of patriarchyFilmfellas26 July 2023A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.It can be many things, but not a kids' film or gender-specific film.Greta takes us into fantasy barbieland with the deep concepts of consumerism, patriarcy, physical insecurity, and self-discovery cleverly layered under it.Conveys all these in a satirical and humorous way subtly and beautifully.I loved how it shows both extremes of patriarchy of men and also women.The sets, visuals, music, and costumes were just so amazing sets the whole vibe.Ken and Barbie had such awesome chemistry and genreated great humor on the screen.I was so excited to see margot robbie & emma mackey together in the film. And they were fantastic. All the others were beautiful, both in looks and acting.There are some really good one-liner and monologues which are funny & make you think at the same time.I felt good hearing about the response for Barbie, considering the talk around baribie being a silly film for only kids or gender s0ecific. But it's much more than that.So, indians, after watching the hyped up oppenheimer, watch Barbie too, and you won't be disappointed.15 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Many Will Go, Most Will EnjoySarah42324 July 2023Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start) So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"I'm Just A Kenpowellian624 July 2023I have successfully completed Barbenheimer and what a wonderful weekend for cinema it was. Every so often is their polar opposite releases but none ever this big. I saw packed theatres consistently on both days which was an amazing thing to be apart of. It felt very much like the old days of going to the theatres for any movie and the auditorium being absolutely packed!Barbie follows stereotypical Barbie as her normal perfect life gets disturbed by something happening in the real world as to which she has to leave Barbie world and fix her life.This is the bare bones of the story but Greta Gerwig explores so much more than that. It's obvious the film is highly inspired by films such as Wizard of Oz, La La Land and 2001 space odyssey to name a few. The talent behind the camera is very obvious and this is extremely stylized film. All of the Barbie stuff is top notch and the sets they built feels like something Tim Burton cooked up. Really excellent set design, costumes and props throughout this film.I was really worried that this film would spend too much time in the real world and it doesn't. It focuses alot of its story in Barbie World which I really appreciated. Margot Robbie is perfect in the role and continues to showcase her acting chops. Ryan Gosling is amazing too he has the perfect comedic timing and delivery. Perfect casting combo for this role.Barbie is a much deeper character exploration and interesting topic point that is very aesthetically shown in this film. No matter what you believe in there is an honest message and I'm sure many girls of all ages will relate to this film on one level or another.4 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Must admit I struggled!paulhopfish24 July 2023I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded. The film was dull at times and at others quite subversive!Some great humour some odd moments, felt a little stilted but that was clearly the intent of the film makers.I sat through it feeling at the end mildly perplexed and unsure if I enjoyed it or not.I felt it was at times quite clever but still a bit confusing much of the time.As a 67 year old I may not be the best judge nor did the chatting 7-8 year old two seats away from me add much to the experience.Go see and make your mind up, overall I much preferred Oppenheimer.4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"A wonderful surprise!hitman_198020 July 2023I went to see this one with my 11 year old daughter, thinking that it would be a movie directed to kids. It's not! Actually, it's one of the best social satires I have seen and many jokes and references will be difficult or even impossible to understand for kids. They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, the script/story is engaging, funny but also very touching at times and the overall result is delightful.You'll find yourself wanting to own this one in your collection, it really is that good.13 out of 62 found this helpful.

"Pink Political Power is: Fun, Funny At Times, Deep, But Aggressively Weirdrgkarim21 July 2023LIKES:The Setting: -It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot's Originality: -Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye -Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting: -McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me -Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times: -The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace: -It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music: -By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message: -There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour: -I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig's Hyper Agenda -I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity: -The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd: -The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place: -My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going -Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT: Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.9 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"A Barbie World?baharperwrites21 July 2023I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.13 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Only thing that saved this was good acting and sound trackjjankel12322 July 2023Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.13 out of 15 found this helpful.

"A hand-crafted ball of serotoninjacksongaming-8009421 July 2023Prepare to embark on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting world of Barbie! This handcrafted ball of serotonin is an absolute delight, leaving your heart brimming with joy from start to finish. Trust me, my cheeks were hurting too, but it was a small price to pay for the unbridled happiness that ensued.In the magical realm of Barbieland, Oscar-worthy set designs work like portals, whisking you away to a realm of imagination and wonder. The chemistry between Margot and Ryan is nothing short of spectacular, radiating an irresistible charm that leaps off the screen and captures your heart.Beyond the surface, the film's plot weaves a tapestry of surprises, defying predictability with cunning twists that keep you guessing throughout. Amid the laughter, ""Barbie"" serves as a brilliant mirror, reflecting upon society's norms, dismantling stereotypes, and fearlessly confronting issues of gender inequality and toxic masculinity. Such clever social commentary adds depth and meaning to this seemingly carefree adventure.As for the comedy, prepare for a sidesplitting experience! Joke after joke lands perfectly, leaving you in stitches and gasping for breath. However, the true comedic gem is none other than Will Ferrel, who delivers a performance that leaves a lasting impression. With impeccable timing and wit, he steals the spotlight in every scene, creating comedic gold that will resonate with audiences of all ages.While the movie does wear the hat of a toy advertisement, it walks the tightrope adeptly. Balancing appeal to the younger audience with engaging entertainment for adults, ""Barbie"" strikes a perfect harmony that caters to both ends of the spectrum.With all the praise deservedly sung, there is only one minor drawback - the movie ends too soon! As the credits roll, you'll find yourself yearning for more of this delightful and captivating experience, a testament to the film's greatness.14 out of 74 found this helpful.

"Fab and Fun, Kenoughariannakerber21 July 2023This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.21 out of 95 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Just enjoy it. It's funny.jcollins-458-41538723 July 2023First off, I'm a 60 year-old white male and this movie wasn't even made for me.If your at all interested, then go see this movie. It's funny. It has a lot of funny lines and scenes.The recreation of the set is incredible, but maybe a little vidual indigestion. You adapt quickly.The characters are really good. Perfect for what they are expected to be. Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed.There is a feminist overtone, but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes. No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion. Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy.The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by today's political environment. This move is a funny comedy that might actually open your eyes to a feminist point of view of you choose to absorb it. If not, you'll still laugh and call it a good time.3 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Flash weird fun that surpasses expectations.cruise0126 July 20234.5 out of 5 stars.Barbie is a pretty good fantasy comedy film that delivers all expectations with a film being based on a beloved doll and toy brand. It is fun. It is dumb in a fun way that adults and children will love which has a story with a theme. Humor and fun characters.Margot Robbie delivers as Barbie. And along with Ryan Gosling as Ken. And rest of the cast ensemble had fun with there roles. Its a story about Barbie played by Margot Robbie who decides to leave barbieland after she has been feeling different about herself. While coming into the real world with Ken. To find out who has been playing with her doll version.Humor is a lot of fun that is entertaining in about every scene. The music soundtrack is awesome. The flashy visuals can be cheesy and knows how to be fun and not taken seriously.Overall, it is one fun summer film that everyone will enjoy.2 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Pleasantly surprised, but maybe it's a bit too muchLimbo8128 July 2023I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...I was expecting some kind of dumb movie, but this is not. It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women. I keep questioning myself about this point of view: little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long, so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life. I find it hard to accept it.Now let's talk about Ken. He only exists because Barbie exists. In Barbie Land he counts nothing. There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste...1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"Barbie: Not For Me, But It's Fine For What It IsCutlasSaber23 July 2023This probably wouldn't come off as a shocker to anyone who knows me, but I'm definitely not the target audience for this film. That doesn't mean I dislike the film in anyway, just thought that would be an important thing to point out before actually reviewing this film.Surprisingly the movie wasn't generic or filled with over-the-top cliches, and judging from the trailer, I thought I'd have seen this story play out so many times before. I mainly expected it to depend on its humor, which is probably the only thing that lived up to my expectations because I'm a way it kind of did. It actually had a compelling message that had decent pacing to lead up to that message (obviously the message wasn't directed towards me in any way, but to young girls who struggle with these issues, that's not to say the message is bad or anything, I just can't say much about a message that's not even directed towards me).Without Ryan Gosling, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this film as much as I did. I'm definitely not saying the other actors were completely horrible in there role, because it's quite the opposite, I just don't think it would've lived up to Gosling's performance to me. I like Margot Robbie as an actress, and I think she does a great job for this role. And for the most part a lot of the actors here were great too of course.If I had to come up with one negative for this film, maybe the gender roles thing was a little preachy, but honestly it doesn't bother me nearly as much as most films handle this subject. I've seen how completely woke certain films can be, and it's not nearly as bad as the way this film handles it so I can't really be too upset about it. Other than that, this is a film you can't really take seriously because it's a comedy. All I can say is this movie was fine, but definitely not for me, and that's ok.4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"Well deserving of the hypeeleanorcrawlings21 July 2023This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.23 out of 55 found this helpful.

"It's Actually Fun to Be in a Barbie Worldajacayen-9024720 July 2023Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's banter with one another, even when they are on their own, are so entertaining to look at, especially Gosling who seems to have a more fun in the movie and is indeed the funniest out of all the cast members.That being said, everyone in the cast seem to be having fun in their own respective roles, living out Barbieland and the real world. But by far the standout would have to Kate McKinnon (Ghostbusters) and America Ferrera (How To Train Your Dragon), who both help Robbie's titular character when she is having an existential crisis.As for the production design, it is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of the film, particularly in BarbieLand where it seemed like the production team really went all-out in making the world, not to mention how they really feel when young girls are playing with Barbie.The film does carry a lot of themes of not just someone trying to overcome an identity loss but also how acceptance should start by loving yourself and not needing to live up to the norms set up by leaders.They are thought-provoking including capitalist feminism (how ideas can make money instead of enjoyment), alongside the idea of growing up which is coming to terms with reality and letting go of the childhood you have cherished - which is well-represented in the fantasy and real world.All the way through, as a comedy, even though some jokes did not land well, most of it are really funny and does put a smile on your face up until the very end.Overall, Barbie continues to prove the amazing directing skills of Greta Gerwig (Little Women, Lady Bird) and alongside her writing craft with her husband Noah Baumbach. With this film alongside Oppenheimer, it is one of the standout films of 2023.13 out of 69 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"Ryan Gosling is the main characteraleksandracritic20 July 2023Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.Physically Margot was a great choice, but she didn't give much. Even when she had the opportunity to act more human, her expressions and acting were still more as a doll, and Ryan did a better job.I didn't know what to expect but I was hoping that it will not be too superficial, and it wasn't. The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography. Girls can relate to many things said in the movie, and I recommend you to watch it in girls company, you will have fun.32 out of 72 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"unexpectedly profoundmarcoarbia21 July 2023Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.9 out of 61 found this helpful.

"What Walt's Watchingwaltermwilliams20 July 2023""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.I know my daughter treasured her Barbie collection into adulthood and thought this was in her own words the ""Best Movie Ever""!The film opens with a brilliant parody to Stanley Kubrick's Sci-Fi Epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Margot Robbie stars as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and believe me she ain't the only Barbie in this Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy with very adult themes You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"". He really does fit into Ken's clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don't forget John Cena as Merman Ken) Listen for: Dame Helen Mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""Barbie Land"" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement ""Barbie"" turns into ""Barbie the Musical""with more singing and dancing than ""La La Land"" in the ""Beach Off"".""Barbie"" she's everything. He's just Ken.If you're a Barbie Girl in a Barbie World then come on to see ""Barbie"". Wear your best pink outfit, let's go party!9 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Surprisingly Amazing For Everyone!baxroth19 July 2023Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!73 out of 231 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"It is, indeed, a Barbie worldcliftonofun23 July 2023Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Not the evil propaganda some people are saying, but also not funny and very shallowMetal_Robots22 July 2023I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.18 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Surprises You, Entertains Youssunny-social24 July 2023One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.The subtext I gather is, the film is about a rich good looking girl who is living her hunky dory life where everything is spik and span. This girl has been metaphored as the Barbie. The girl who understands little of the real world until life hits her with ugly truth (revealed at the end) and she starts feeling real pain and emotions. At first she denies it and fights it and also gets it all back for a brief moment. Later she realizes, she wants to live real and wants to let go of the made up cocoon of beauty, perfection and pink.Entertaining, fresh and perfect Sunday morning watch to setup for an interesting discussion later in the evening.2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Barbie Impresses in an Interesting Wayj-mayo199921 July 2023Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script. No doubt a movie that was need for this summer's box office.6 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"<3gracecahill-0888522 July 2023This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.11 out of 26 found this helpful.

"Entertaining, silly summer movie but not really a funny comedystrunckjl23 July 2023Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it outPros: 1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since 2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters 3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punchCons: 1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film.1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Forget the advertising, it's a Barbie movie.brenogualdani20 July 2023With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been.10 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6

"What is Barbie?glorifcus28 July 2023Was I expecting more from great gerwig? Yes!Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed or forgotten in the case of one. The film comedy is pastels and pink like it's colors, but aesthetically speaking, not even its pastels are fully realized or pushed to the its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them. Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being told to me, but I never actually believed it, Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigor life. Also. Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on like is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird.1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I've heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a ""fun"" movie about ""being a women?""...HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did I see so many details about the Barbie world but got a grasp of what Greta was saying about society l. About women. Men. Corporations. Mothers. Daughters. War.Do your self a favor.

"A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Thirdnysmbs26 July 2023Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Hilarious with genuine touches of emotionthomasduggins22 July 2023I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.It does not disappoint. Margot Robbie brought a depth of emotion to the role that makes it a special character and performance. America Ferrera also was sensational and is probably an under appreciated actor for as much as she consistently delivers in her films and shows.Gosling, Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir brought plenty of the expected levity for the Ken roles. Gosling is well known for both his dramatic and comedic abilities at this point, but selfishly watching him ham it up and be funny never gets old.As expected, the movie had plenty of ludicrously silly moments that and brought humor from a lot of different directions and perspectives.Specifically, the mini-dissection of the patriarchy and evolution of the characters to more fully realize themselves played very well to me.I could not recommend this movie enough. As worthwhile as any two hours you can spend.10 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Conflict BarbieEntertainmentsparadise21 July 2023Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal.6 out of 33 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

I found myself laughing and crying throughout the film. The movie is incredibly well done, and the entire cast was phenomenal. I highly encourage everyone to watch the film, it perfectly balanced real, current issues while remaining a really fun film.Margot Robbie blew the role of Barbie out of the water, and Ryan Gosling as Ken was absolute perfection.

"A ""Barbie"" girl on the loose from her ""Barbie"" world, a fun mixed film of fantasy and reality.blanbrn21 July 2023Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light.

"Super fun, super colorful, and very plastic!scubadoo-3525626 July 2023The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!5 out of 16 found this helpful.

"How very on brand!! Style over substance...wyannjameson21 July 2023Making a movie is hard. Super hard. Making one for a huge IP to sell the hell of of merchandise- even harder. But, for approx $150M, this should have been SO much better, in every way.Where it really struggled was with its thin narrative and ACTUAL character development. From a story crafting perspective it's all over the place and spends too much time fighting for cheap laughs (ahem, extra cheap) instead of developing a story around what the human experience is vs. The idea of doll-like perfection. It claws to be profound and existential, but never develops past gender stereotypes. As if GENDER bias was ever the issue with Barbie?! Let's talk about female expectations, expressions, and our evolution!It somehow managed to still feel shallow, which ironically was what the script wanted to subvert. Creating something that's nuanced and not heavy handed takes real craft. This wasn't craft, it was a CASH grab.No go buy all the merchandise, cuz... capitalism!!105 out of 172 found this helpful.

"Barbie, Barbie, Barbieymrhqtrz22 July 2023I somehow managed to convince my immensely macho friend to watch this film with me and boy was it an amazing experience! Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.4 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"weakness to strengthJankiSharma24 July 2023Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble.5 out of 43 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Stereotypical Barbie becomes a martyr for DEI BarbielandAirman8721 July 2023When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.3 out of 13 found this helpful.

"A shrewd satire?catooooo25 July 2023Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.Nevertheless, the film achieves this with a genuinely humorous approach, inserting clever jokes in moments where the plot becomes dense, interrupting the atmosphere and eliciting laughter from a significant portion of the audience. Personally, while experiencing this situation, I was one of the few gentlemen who attended the screening individually, surrounded by women, and I delighted in the subtly acidic references and humor about current affairs.I greatly enjoyed how the film incorporates references to other cinematic classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Godfather,"" two films that are historically revered as some of the best of all time. Moreover, the work addresses contemporary controversies, such as patriarchy, feminism, and the stereotypes imposed on bodies deemed ""perfect.""I won't delve into the details of the plot, as it unfolds linearly, as expected in this film. Its development is solid and fitting, focused on a main objective of exposing the marked contrast between our sociocultural reality and a fictional dimension imbued with idealized visions. I must express my surprise at this creation since it was expected that it would merely promote a new collection of Barbie dolls or evoke superficial nostalgia, yet it turned out to be precisely the opposite.One aspect that I would like to emphasize is the careful selection of actors, where Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling embody the stereotype of beauty, both female and male, that society deems ""perfect."" Both actors, in their respective roles, present themselves as vulnerable to various challenges inherent to their genders. The film conveys a message that despite possessing a body considered ""perfect"" or conforming to the Barbie stereotypes, it does not negate the possibility of experiencing distress, sadness, fatigue from wearing heels, or confronting the presence of cellulite, ultimately preventing us from being everything we aspire to be. This message intertwines with the reality of women in modern times, addressing the complexities and challenges they face in their daily lives.The film fulfills its objective by serving as a critique of society, admittedly leaning towards an unfavorable perspective on the male gender while taking for granted the superiority of the female gender. As a man, I personally was not offended by the jokes directed at the male gender in the film; on the contrary, I appreciated how the film vividly portrays the simplicity, happiness, and lack of complications that we, as men, can achieve.Without further ado, adorned with a rosy hue and brief musical moments that do not overwhelm, adding to Barbie's experience, even though it is targeted at a specific audience, it proves to be exceptionally enjoyable. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend it. After all, who wouldn't want to laugh at themselves while acknowledging our human nature, filled with imperfections?4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"Barbie: an enjoyable mess.shayenu20 July 2023Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and cliché.The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!10 out of 42 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A great balance between social commentary and pure funspelakokosinek19 July 2023The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song. Great job!44 out of 146 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"It's Barbie and it's Ken!chand-suhas21 July 2023Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end. If the first hour provides genuine humor, it is the second half that truly make it a thorough entertainer blending humor with emotions.4 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Glad I watch this movie, fantastic!Mysterygeneration23 July 2023Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.Barbie's aspirational charm contributes to her brand's strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig's interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.While making Ryan Gosling's dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children's film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""appropriation"" - pretty much everything but ""problematic,"" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie's legacy.The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie ""Barbie"" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women's movement in addition to making light of Mattel.With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn't be understated, since much of Gerwig's approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children's imaginations develop while playing with Barbies.1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Wolf in Sheep's Clothinglukell-9615522 July 2023This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that.67 out of 97 found this helpful.

"Fun and insightfultabletopcouchpotato21 July 2023I am a big fan of Greta Gerwig but not a Barbie fan. I got excited by all the promo but didn't know what to expectThe movie exceeded my expectations so much. It was fun and absurdist but also profound.The depth in the movie is the perfect level - it doesn't go too far and still feels fun and playful but still does deep explorations. It's also just really funny and clever and campy in the best way.I loved the costuming, the set design, the cinematography and the acting. I was skeptical about Ryan Gosling as Ken but his performance was so good! Margot Robbie was perfect as well. This movie was so fun and so creative and interesting.8 out of 41 found this helpful.

"I feel so seen- and that's what Barbie is!zillizard22 July 2023I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the ""human woman"" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you're watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll's origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled ""I am."") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it. No need to watch the whole series if it's not your bag.5 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Cute existentialismJithindurden21 July 2023Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?3 out of 22 found this helpful.

"Whit, charm, and lots to saygreasefreak21 July 2023This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.15 out of 75 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Fun filled with depthruelshepperd25 July 2023Greta Gerwig hasn't missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film. Similar to The Lego Movie, this film appears to be a harmless, funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie, great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages.The plot is fairly straightforward with our main Barbie going on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, while Ken does the same. A simple premise but well executed. The plot deals with themes such as gender, equality, the loss of childhood and the nature of growing up with such good humour and heart. I had a smile on my face the entire time.The performances are strongest from the two leads, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Both bring a lot of energy and life to Barbie and Ken, communicating the struggles of being both a man and woman and how one can't exist without the other. They have excellent chemistry and both inject their roles with great emotion. The rest of the cast are good though some felt unnecessary. Will Ferrell's CEO could have benefitted from more screen time or could've even been cut completely. Yet he is still hilarious in the scenes he is in.The set design is immaculate, Barbieland was a joy to witness. My only issue is we could've spent more time there. The score was great and the cinematography further helped with the immersion. Production-wise this film is gorgeous.The only problems are a few too many times of the film hammering it's message in to the point it can become annoying. There are also a few lines and jokes that don't land at all and seem entirely of the time. Yet, these are minor in the face that everything does right.Overall, Barbie is a lot of fun, with great comedy and a lot of heart. The leads are great, the set design is immaculate and the message is strong and positive. A fun film that I highly recommend.2 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Could it ever meet expectations?watchitwombat23 July 2023Barbie Movie Review She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.By Nick @WatchItWombat.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"The most magical pink fever dreampeterboddie21 July 2023I had no idea what to expect, but the trailers made me smile. Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations. The music, costumes, sets and actors all were the perfect pink sprinkles on top.12 out of 50 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"A Good Movie That Should Have Been A Great Moviejgeorge422 July 2023This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"KenoughAziz2423 July 2023Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, ""a party for everyone, and everyone is invited"". But, young kids (especially today's new young generation) will feel like it's not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren't done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that's due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother's character and the daughter's character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for"" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song's lyrics and Billie's voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken's character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel's Shang-Chi (2021).Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta's films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: ""4 tickets for the Barbie movie please"". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling's Ken is: ""Every night is boys' night"".Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about.

"The perfect tribute to Barbie!thetreejuice21 July 2023I'm a huge fan of Barbie, so when I heard there was a movie coming out, I was beyond excited & I certainly wasn't disappointed when I got to see it!The cast are incredible & all seem to bounce off of each other, the story was funny but also heartwarming at the same time, and the attention to detail was marvellous, in true Barbie fashion.One thing I really enjoyed was how it managed to pay tribute to so many different variations of Barbie, shout out to Weird Barbie! (We all had a weird Barbie!)Overall the film was truly a pleasure to watch & I just wish I could go to Barbie-Land, someone get me some Rollerblades please?11 out of 65 found this helpful.

"Fun EnoughTweetienator22 July 2023Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken. Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes, but the ""message"" (you know all that blabla about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the cliches regarding gender from a certain point of view) drag the whole movie rather down - at least for me. For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of Mattel to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of today's zeitgeist - I take any bet, the sells will rise these days profoundly. Anyway, if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those ""preaching elements"" you may find some entertainment (like I did), but if you are fed up with such ""progressive"" matters, you should avoid watching this one. Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media, and the plot rather a very predictable one, indeed.1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"A telling of modern day society through Barbieburntoutboy21 July 2023Who would have thought that a film about Barbie would be one of the most original, fresh film of recent years.There are so many positives of Barbie. First of all, the cast is brilliant. They work very well and are perfect for their roles, specifically Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (Oscar worthy in my opinion). A special mention to Michael Cera though for being spot on with his character.It's funny but also unexpectedly touching and really showcases the problems with modern day society in an inventive way.There was also surprises that were good and suited the narrative.Some criticisms are it's drags in certain scenes and it's definitely not for everyone but I guess that's cinema for you.Barbie is worth the watch!Edit: actually watched it for a second time and it's just a fun movie with really detailed set designs and cleverly thought out mannerisms.6 out of 39 found this helpful.

"""BARBIE"" REVIEWMr-Topshotta23 July 2023Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. A runtime of one hour and fifty-four minutes. With a PG-13 rating.Narrated throughout by Helen Mirren. Starring Margot Robbie playing the world-famous Mattel toy company character ""Barbie"", specifically ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Also starring her playmate/partner and fellow toy ""Ken"", specifically ""Beach Ken"" played by Ryan Gosling.Life in ""Barbie Land"" is magnificent. Every morning is spectacular. With ""President Barbie"" played by Issa Rae, ""Doctor Barbie played by Alexandra Shipp, and ""Physicist Barbie"" played by Margot Robbie doppelgänger Emma Mackey to name a few.With many different ""Kens"" played by John Cena, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir who's playing ""Bob Marley in next year's biopic, and Ncuti Gatwa to name a few. Oh, and you can't forget about ""Allan"" played by Michael Cera.Every day is magical until it's not. After ""Stereotypical Barbie"" started getting some weird thoughts. She is advised by ""Weird Barbie"" played by SNL Alum Kate McKinnon to go to the real world and find her human.Not wanting to leave her side ""Beach Ken"" hitches along for the ride. But once in the real world, they will learn new harsh realities. Between ""Stereotypical Barbie"" now adult human ""Gloria"" played by America Ferrera and her teenage daughter ""Sasha"" played by Ariana Greenblatt things are far from how life is in ""Barbie Land"".With ""Beach Ken"" as well getting a heavy dose of reality. These new revelations jeopardize life in ""Barbie Land"" as a whole. It will take everyone including ""Mattel Ceo"" played by Will Ferrell to fix everything that's been forever altered.""Barbie"" from the start was said to be different. Co-Writer and director Greta Gerwig said this wasn't going to be a typical ""Barbie"" film and that the viewer will be surprised. She couldn't be more right.This film appealed to little girls and women as a whole. It was deep. It touched on emotions and feelings all women feel, have felt, or will feel at some point in their life. Many women cried while watching the film because of how hard some of the points in the film hit.It wasn't all serious. It also wasn't all pink and rainbows too. It had jokes that everyone could laugh at while also having jokes that only the older viewer would get. It made sure to not take itself too seriously but also have points to make you think. I laughed throughout the film. It was really funny.The ""Kens"" were hilarious morons. Both ""Ken"" and ""Barbie"" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today's climate.It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don't judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film. Ryan Gosling knew the assignment.All ages, genders, and nongenders will enjoy this film. With obvious points paying homage to women. A fun film I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. Expect a lot of different emotions with some hard-hitting realities as well. Once again I have to give a shout-out to the director/co-writer for hitting the mark. Because that's a big task to ask.This was an excellent film weekend with ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"". With their respective writer/director doing an amazing job doing both. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but I expect most women to rate this five mor fires. Which makes perfect sense.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin #CosmoMovieBlog #CosmoLanier #Barbie.1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Barbie is everythingreisenachjerusalem23 July 2023Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget. Thank you Greta Gerwig for my life.3 out of 16 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Spectacular!UniqueParticle22 July 2023Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw in RPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.I probably laughed at more parts than most people and was engaged throughout. Perfect mix of kid story, The Matrix, and a lot more packed in really well! Greta Gerwig made an important film and plenty of charm for everyone involved. Lovable experience with a lot of important controversy that I didn't expect out of left field. I had most of this up already but deleted and edited out multiple things maybe this is better.1 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Robbie is perfection, Gosling is 'just okay'matt-2763421 July 2023Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too! I'd be disappointed if this film isn't up for any major awards for the above-mentioned.Barbie was super fun! It's also a movie that can be watched for many years to come and still seem current and relevant.#barbie #barbiethemovie.4 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Genius! We need more movies like this one!fthkgdcc23 July 2023Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10 rating. The Godfather of whatever this movie's genre is....3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Hey Twitter, lets go party!raulvg-3115120 July 2023Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside) While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.The movie is fun and has great performances, hats off to Margot Robbie, but, Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu's Kens stole every scene. The rest of the acting and cast is just fine, I don't believe I've seen a single bad performance.For a particularly comedy film, I feel like my session lacked laughs. Throughout the film, I laugh in very few scenes, but I also understand that they are directed at children and so on. (ignoring the last part, there are some jokes with double meanings, nothing that children would understand, watch it calmly with the little ones!)...but I have to admit, the movie didn't get me. Actually, it was one of the few times that I almost fell asleep in the cinema. This time, me and my company, we yawned so much that we started to cry from sleep, but we didn't pass out. The reason i'm writing this last part is because i can understand the 1 and the 10 reviews... it just hits people in different ways. The only bad thing this movie did is make me sick of the color pink. Seriously, the theater was packed with people wearing only pink. Even suits and formal wear, I know it's because of the memes... but things get out of hand ,_,7 out of 40 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"An Extremely Clever and Entertaining Experiencekjproulx26 July 2023Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.To keep it simple, the film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbieland. Accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), they venture to the real world. With many revelations about how awful our world is, the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life. I'm keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour. I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end.Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy-handed, but I didn't. In fact, I found that the messages actually made the film better overall. Yes, it's a film that explores equal rights, but it does so in a fashion that doesn't downgrade anyone, but rather puts others on a higher pedestal. I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented. I shouldn't have been too surprised though, because Greta Gerwig as a director is just fabulous.Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women, Gerwig has continued to impress me as a director, even if I haven't exactly loved any of her films yet. Well, I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date. There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great. I mean, with that said, it didn't hurt that the cast was perfection.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface, but America Ferrera and Simu Liu were also standouts to me. Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldn't get enough of the whole cast. Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well, but in the end, this is a film that all came down to the screenplay. Yes, the set design is award-worthy, the musical number is worthy of an Oscar-nomination, but Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach crafted a genius script here. The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me. Their attention to detail was perfect here. I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders.1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Barbie discovers the not so perfect world.Ruben1720 July 2023It's weird yet fun movie! It keeps getting better by the minutes, had a good portion of fun but also a few emotional moments.It's not made for everyone but try and keep a clear mind while watching it!The casting choice were sublime and each Barbie, Ken and even Alan nailed there performances.The few cameos were also pretty fun, and with a lovely touch at moments.Some scenes were a bit dragged out but because of the characters it kinda felt like i was okey with it.It has it ups and downs but it was mostly entertaining and i think that was it's main goal and they succeeded in that.If you are a Barbie fan you'll definitely have a blast!9 out of 65 found this helpful.

"Pinklandjack_o_hasanov_imdb26 July 2023This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is everything & bring on Kenergyheidiej23 July 2023I don't think I've been this excited about a movie in a long while.It was somewhat different than what I was expecting, but in some fantastic ways. Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.America Ferrera - fantastic. She brought me to tears Ryan Gosling was a scene stealer! His Kenergy was phenomenal - in a movie where he was literally ""and Ken"" Greta Gerwig truly brought the entire Barbieland to life.I laughed, I cried , I ugly cried and I'm still revisiting every moment.5 out of 22 found this helpful.

"a love letter to women, girlhood and growing up outside of a world run by the patriarchyatomeckova23 July 2023To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one). I think it's an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else <3.3 out of 14 found this helpful.

"BarbieCinemaSerf26 July 2023""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Farrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

So fun!jdjerika23 July 2023A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all What I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!7 out of 24 found this helpful.

"A fun movie with a political agendamydogjustdied20 July 2023Barbie is a really fun movie that sets itself up with a lighthearted premise. The humor is self aware, the set design is immaculate, the actors are perfect for their roles. But eventually it turns itself into a feminist commentary on the patriarchy. This by itself isn't horrible, it's just quite heavy handed. I understand why they did it, Barbie as a concept has seen controversy in recent years and it would've sparked more controversy if they made a movie completely blind to it and not addressing it at all. But it's just.. not what you're looking for when you go see a Barbie film. In fairness, if they went the other route by simply nostalgia bating, I'm sure people would've called it hollow, money grabbing and meaningless. There's no way this movie could ever satisfy everyone. Personally I think the movie would've been better with a tad less social commentary and more focus on the whimsical storyline. Other than that, no qualms about the execution. This is still a really fun movie if you can handle a little political pandering.12 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Hi Barbie!chenp-5470823 July 2023Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.Many elements like the narrative, structures, tone, humor, and style were pretty good as Garwig's direction and Baumbach's writing helped to carry the film with some great satirical dramatic tones throughout. The soundtrack was pretty good although there were an few soundtracks choice was that were kind of bad (that Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj ""Barbie World"" was horrendous) and a few writing moments that could have been a little better.For the most part, Barbie succeeds because the film understands itself with its non-serious tone and provides a fun and bright entertainment of a film. Oppenheimer and Barbie indeed makes a great double feature.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Not all is peachy when things get preachyeddie_baggins27 July 2023It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.A talent-laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Gerwig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baumbach to bring Matel's beloved creation to life, Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists, in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak, Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging, making the film one that doesn't always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging.A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Barbenheimer (with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion) reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe, the adoration aimed at Gerwig's film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months/years too something more grounded, with Gerwig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesn't just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who aren't deserving of the women in their lives.At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight Lycra or where Gosling's MVP performance as Ken see's the horse obsessed and Matchbox 20 loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments, Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its ""human"" characters like America Ferrera's Gloria or Will Ferrell's unnecessary tickle loving Mattel CEO, forgoing its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilises.When fun and adventure is at the forefront of Barbie's agenda, Gerwig's film is an undeniable delight and you'd be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time, it's hard not too consider Barbie's public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of (pink) rose-tinted glasses.Final Say -There's fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold, as is the world which Gerwig brings to life but when Barbie forgoes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging, the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment.3 Mojo Dojo Casa House's out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Days of Fun Movies are overomerus9121 July 2023Walked out during intermission.Visually, a fantastic job. Big props to the art and costume crew. Barbie Land was incredibly well made. The colors and the lighting in the film were on point.Not a bad idea for the plot, but the movie itself didn't care about the plot.Execution... You may as well get a hot pink piece of paper and a bright yellow pen, write ""Men are bad. Patriarchy is bad. Women are good. Unless they're really attractive, in which case they're also bad."" and read it aloud over and over and over again for 2 hours.The trailer made it seem like this would be a sort of movie that hasn't really been made since the mid-2000s which is a fun (""fun"" being the keyword) adventure with silly/supernatural elements to it.

"Exactly what it should belmabrink-1746319 July 2023Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.37 out of 132 found this helpful.

"OKwilleandersen20 July 2023The movie is okay if you wanna have a laugh and entertainment.The script is a bit weird but it has it point.Goslint and Margot are so good in their characters.The first 45 are a bit intensive and laughable. But ""the second half"" are enjoyable with a fun and more realistic view.Barbie shows and tells the hard lite of a woken in the real world but also the hard world of Ken in the barbie world.The moviemaker takes up the life of barbies that our childhood was obsessed with. Clothes,cars,houses and characters in a perfect way.The movie has a cirkus plot and a bit raily but in the end it is OK.12 out of 34 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

A HONEST REVIEWofficialerrt21 July 2023People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie. Know the lawsuits which Mattel brought to those who used Barbie as Satire. 64 years of history in.one hour and fifty-four minutes.24 out of 111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

It was great but...helenahansn24 July 2023I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe It was also so silly and fun.But it was alot and honstly a bit too long.It was saying alot of what felt like important things but somehow it felt flat.Maybe i just like a movie that just is a movie.Though it is so understandalbe that in that Barbie universe they like to explore and acknowledge those huge subjects such as gender equality. In that veiw the small problem i have is they may have tried to hard and the story got lost a bit.In the light of all that Someway somehow it becomes though fun a bit of an forgettable experience.Ps. Tiny Spolier: What about the kens. There story made me feel Abit sad and I wanted a happier ending for them.2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6
"Everyone watch thiskimberlyely-2755025 July 2023BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.2 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Wrapped in Plastic, It's Fantasticelicopperman24 July 2023After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis, all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the doll's spirits. Before going into the story itself, the ensemble cast must be addressed, especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively. In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other, the multiple Barbies and Kens around Barbieland showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots. Alongside them is America Ferrera as Mattel employee Gloria who has as much to do with Barbie's existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase, showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making. Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world, the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats.Now as far as the film itself is concerned, the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its worldbuilding makes no sense at all. Barbieland is supposed to be the place where all the Barbies and Kens live their lives to the fullest, yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them. That being said, since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society, the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is. While it's difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets, especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today, its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism. This is what partially leads to Barbie's wanting to leave her ""perfect"" paradise and Ken's attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be. Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure?Of course, the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature. In contrast to the mundane real world, Barbieland is composed of bright colors and make-believe dream houses, complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape. As the Barbies function through pretend toy logic, there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and Mattel did to them in the long run. The addition of much cartoony stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe. Next to Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers, one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the film's tone and commercial exploitation. It's hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not, but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes.In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why it's ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal beatdowns and forced maturity. Whether or not you've ever been into the Barbie toy line, this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual filmgoer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies. It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes, it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity, and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays.1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Barbie is awesomedanielatala821 July 2023Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it's so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That's where things get a bit complicated.Example; There's no actual ""real"" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would've made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them ""deep"" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don't think that was Greta's intention, not if you see the movies that she's done before where there's always a singular perspective but here I think she's kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it's in their moments where the comedy shines the most.Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would've made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn't make demands about this but I feel like there would've been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the ""real world"" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted? Not really, but I'm glad that it exists, I'm glad that I saw it. Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic. Instead it feels just good and that's ok. I wanted it to be more of an adult-oriented movie and maybe that's where Greta kind of flubbed it, trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesn't succeed at neither and that's alright.2 out of 25 found this helpful.

"I'd probably drop it at around 1/2 if I watched it alone at homeJoytoyxx20 July 2023Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice.140 out of 205 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4
"A beautiful portrayal of negativity of real world with humorramiz_hasan19 July 2023It was beautiful and brilliant, didn't expect it's gonna be too good. Greta tells the -ve side of the real world beautifully wrapped in humor and childhood nostalgia for many.Margot is the STAR, she's unreal man, whatever role she does it seems she's born for that.Ryan was brilliant and so was Will Ferrel, both did an outstanding job. The take on patriarchy is nicely done, Greta is a brilliant director.Just speechless to see how Margot Robbie every single time nail the character she plays, she's just outstanding whether it's Harley or Barbie, she's born to play these roles.Go and experience the Barbie world.18 out of 97 found this helpful.

"A hysterically funny and clever triumph from Gerwigbastille-852-73154723 July 2023In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.The consistently entertaining and uproarious script is made more impactful by great performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who are both absolutely joys to watch as Barbie and Ken, respectively. The supporting cast is great too, with standouts being Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera. Another standout of the film is the superb production design and associated aesthetic qualities of Barbie Land, which is absolutely stunning to look at visually. While the film's tone is often comedic (which is great, given how clever and funny it is,) its more serious themes are still handled very sensitively, including a very powerful monologue from America Ferrera and an emotionally engaging resolution to the story. Sharp, incisive, original, and fun, ""Barbie"" is an outstanding movie that audiences will remember long after the credits roll, and I truly can't wait for Gerwig's next film. 9.5.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Goofy, girly, and gorgeousaivilovee25 July 2023I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.2 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"The Kenergy was Kenough for me.khalidmoubile22 July 2023Barbie.Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.I've just watched Barbie and here me out, I was aware of what I'm going to receive, it was exactly what I thought!Barbie is a fun light movie that you can't take that serious in it's big picture , you just enjoy the colors, the dynamic and the concept in general... The plot was kind of interesting, it makes you attached to the movie, the characters were silly but in a mostly funny way, it really had its funny moments especially with Ryan Gosling as Ken he was hilarious, I liked what he did here and Margot fits perfectly no need to say more about her.The only thing that made me uncomfortable is that they were trying to send messages through this film, it's not about the manner but the quantity, a dozen of them if I'm not afraid but it wasn't that forced to be fair.Enjoy it, the Kenergy was Kenough for me!0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So perfectly castedHarlowwinslet-292-20934620 July 2023I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased. They left the movie in the perfect place and I don't need more. One and done and I'm ok with it.5 out of 34 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,7

"It's Barbie and It's KendorMancyx24 July 2023On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.In terms of story, though, not much success can be claimed. With the movie's central conflict revolve around gender inequity, Barbie highlights the problem clearly, but provides an ambiguous answer. Although Gloria's monologue was unquestionably badass, both her and Sasha's character arcs are quite unconvincing. In general, the film gives either opaque or passive solutions to gender issues, which align with mainstream opinion, but are inherently fantastical especially with the plain storyline.In my opinion, Barbie's box office wonder largely results from its marketing, whether the grand casting, the luring mystique, or the bombastic pink. And yes, the movie is incredible for its aestheticism and creativity, but the story is overly fantastical and lacking gravity.0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"It was amazingaanyasingh-9069521 July 2023I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.14 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Heavy duty marketingnathaliacardozo21 July 2023The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated.6 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"It's not what I expected but in a good wayjuodvilte21 July 2023The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of : 1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂 2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch 3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world 4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏 5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.6. Great props makes you feel like they're actually in a plastic house.42 out of 133 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Fun and not overly complicatedpri_e22 July 2023I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The glorification of misandry.TristanSilya22 July 2023On the surface it's a fun and bubbly movie. Lots of cool colors, cool design, fun styles and music. Barbie world is pretty cool and makes you want to be a part of it. Unfortunately this isn't really a Barbie movie.In terms of accuracy they've changed a lot of things about Barbie and what Barbie is supposed to be about.When you dig a bit deeper (you actually don't have to dig at all if you're wise and have an eye for subliminal messages, social cues, and agendas) you quickly it's mainly a movie about misandry.Basically ""men are dumb and bad"" and ""women should pursue career"" and they wrapped the whole premise in a giant Barbie flashy skin. It's quite concerning how much damage this movie will actually do to our society because many impressionable kids and young adults will watch this and be influenced by it without even being aware of it.32 out of 54 found this helpful.

"This isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.I_Ailurophile27 July 2023Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Genuinely Hilariousemiliacross19 July 2023Ignore all of the salty toxic masculinity comments, this movie was perfect.Such a clever and witty script. Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling played their roles flawlessly.It was so much fun and the references and narration were brilliant. Truly funny comedy & sharp social commentary.It touched on so many important themes surrounding gender, our patriarchal society and capitalism.It is definitely a feminist movie for women who grew up playing with the dolls.One of the best things I've seen in a long while.The set design and costumes were totally brilliant.Go see it!

"Barbie is fun!skylermoore24 July 2023As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Beautifully done moviestevieltamasi21 July 2023I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman.16 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Not All That CleverWHBower22 July 2023I regret that I allowed myself to be swept up by the Barbie hype.I'm sure it will resonate with the ladies.Gents, you can wait 'til it streams.It's just not nearly as clever as I'd hoping it'd be. Yes, I was fully expecting a message, but not one that would be hammered onto our heads.Zero subtlety and a deficiency of real wit.There was a moment in the film that held promise, re: Ken and the subject of masculinity, but it was squandered.This film is very fortunate for the Barbenheimer phenomenon, because I'm not sure word of mouth could have served it as well.I love me a chick flick - just not this one.1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"AmazingSpaghettimuncher22 July 2023Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.There were so many emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears the ending scene was honestly so incredibly emotional but it was amazing.Margot robbie was an amazing casting choice she played the role of barbie so fantastically, the casting choice for ken could have been better but honestly ryan gosling did amazing at his role aswell.Honestly this movie healed my inner child it was so amazing and i definitely recommend you go and see it because the movie actually is very funny but you probably will end up tearing up at some point.19 out of 52 found this helpful.

"A largely positive message, wrapped in a fun package but the execution could have been improvedta-9825123 July 2023Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A masterpiece made by women for women.cathimaria22 July 2023Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.To the men who feel attacked by this film, please feel attacked. This is an attack on men and rightfully so. Barbie doesn't stretch the truth or make a mockery, she puts life on the screen exactly how it is. Barbie is a mirror.And once again to the men who feel like ""this isn't for me"". If you are a heterosexual male attracted to women, the logical conclusion is to celebrate and enjoy femininity, to express curiosity, care and interest for women. A film that centres around women should immediately take your interest!To all the women reading this review, if you haven't seen the film yet, please indulge yourselves and do so. I hope you find joy, peace and love in all moments of your life x.10 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"I fee sorry to those who fell in the Barbenheimer trapAzureus9120 July 2023To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.41 out of 58 found this helpful.

"So unexpected and so good.catelynmj21 July 2023I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!19 out of 90 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"""Sex Education"" with Barbiesi_odin23 July 2023Greta Gerwig's Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history. The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave.It is both a celebration as well as a quip on the Barbie world. Barbie deals with the modern day gender issues and how Barbie (the company) stands as a symbol of all those issues. At the same time it cleverly portrays the emotions involved of all those who love and admire this pop symbol.Margot Robbie is excellent as Barbie. Her performance range is phenomenal. Gerwig uses her aptly. Gosling is cute and is being judiciously used for his charm and handsome vulnerability that he brings. All the supporting casts (most of them are from just one show hence the title of this review) have done their job well. Can't say I am particularly impressed by any one though as there isn't much for them to do. Although Will Ferrel and America Ferrera are an exception as they shines in their limited appearance and steal the show.The music, production design and direction along with Baumbach's writing is outrageously entertaining and often funny as well. The bizarre world of Barbie will be loved not just by the ones who carry a nostalgic baggage of playing with one in their childhood but also to those who have never ever heard about it. Such is the charm of this movie.1 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Watch it in 70MM if you dare !!!!drneshom25 July 2023I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM cinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more.. Simply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try.5 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Best Communal Cinema Experience Since Endgamelstuart_berry22 July 2023I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.12 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,1
"Gretta Gereig Approached Mattelj_kurzyn28 July 2023Just want to get this out of the way: Greta Gerwig approached Mattel and wrote the film. Not the other way around.This movie is super fun. Where this movie shines is the acting, production design, and soundtrack. The script is dense with jokes however it feels like it's trying to be too much all at once. The big monolgue was solid though and the subplot with the mother and daughter was emotional and authentic.Regardless, some people will be offened by or feel left out because, for example, the trans representation (or lack thereof). It is very binary but the film can't be everything to everyone and Mattel I imagine doesn't want to get involved in the culture wars. Whether that's an asset or liability is yours to determine.Overall it's enjoyable but like Christopher Nolan who also has a film competing with it, Barbie tries to be too complicated and vague in order to seem clever. That being said, it hits A LOT on the head. I recommend.1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"Awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn moviegrinningelvis27 July 2023The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"Hilarious and Thoughtfultalking_about_movies22 July 2023This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.This is a fun, over the top, laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message. I loved how much fun it had in doing that. It used comedy as a tool to prove its point. It's not easy guys. Making a satire itself is not easy, let alone turning Barbie into a good movie.The over-the-top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius. It reminded me of ""Don't Look Up"". That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlikeable to prove its point using humour. There are dialogues in this movie where I was like, it's funny but yeah, it needed to be said. The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment, was genius.Everyone in this movie is having so much fun. The actors, all of them gave hilarious performances. Ryan Gosling, especially, was so funny. His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie.This movie is so self aware, that I wouldn't have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer.It has a few problems though. While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect, I thought the way Barbie's character was concluded didn't make much sense and was sort of contradictory. And given that it's a very over the top comedy, some scenes do stretch a bit too much. It can get a bit too preachy at times too.But honestly, I had a great time. I would highly recommend watching this in theatres. In fact, my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie.2 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Barbie... Better than I thought, but fell a little shortcinemaconnoisseur-5282322 July 2023Scoreboard:Overall Score: 6.7Storyline/Plot: 6.8Acting: 8Directing: 7Ending: 7Cinematography: 6.5Comedy: 6.8Action: 5.9Overall Review:Firstly, in all my years of being a Cinema Connoisseur, it is rare to see a movie sell out as quickly and widespread as Barbie. So well done to the Barbie marketing team!I walked in the cinema with no expectations, but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie. I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn't go overboard.Overall, ""Barbie"" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.Isit worth a watch?... Whether you are a woman or man, young or old. Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to. So for that reason it is worth a watch, but don't go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan!2 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Barbenheimer! Decent comedy handled with a sledgehammerotaku-9071021 July 2023Saw this kind of late on 07/21 after Oppenheimer. As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3. So I'm going with 4.62 out of 96 found this helpful.

"NOSTALGIAvalfrae23 July 2023This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are. I love that I'm just like other girls!!1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Barbie a Must Seearuminger21 July 2023This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!17 out of 45 found this helpful.

"Barbie it's interesting, confusing, and a lot of funfelipedesouzarosa24 July 2023Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Gorgeousjosephirose26 July 2023This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.3 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"She's Everything. He's Just Ken.UnderTheScene23 July 2023Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
Such an empowering movie!snperera25 July 2023This movie has such a powerful message for women everywhere! The set is amazing and the movie is so funny. The writing is so clever and funny! It made me feel so powerful and validated! I really enjoyed it! Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie! And Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken! I feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other Barbies and Kens were great! I loved how there were different type of Barbies in the movie! Being a woman is amazing and powerful and I hate how the world doesn't respect us or take us seriously. There was some slow parts and jokes that didn't land for me but overall it was a great film!1 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8
"Just watched the barbie movieCurtain_Call_Films22 July 2023When you have a cast as big as this film the space for error is low, and although the movie is lots of fun there are still some nitpicks. Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.2 out of 11 found this helpful.

"this is the movie of humanitynsbsnvp20 July 2023I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.17 out of 79 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"The mainstream doll with not such a mainstream filmTomTalksFilms28 July 2023I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SEEING????661jda26 July 2023This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.3 out of 3 found this helpful.

"A film that truly lives up to the hypeethanbresnett26 July 2023A Barbie movie helmed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling... what could possibly go wrong? Practically nothing it seems, as this movie is a complete knock out in every possible way.It is hilarious from start to finish with a sharply funny, meta, intelligent script that is matched by the masterfully executed physical comedy.The story is emotional and powerful and meaningful which I did not expect, but this proved to be such a vital and welcome part of the film.The entire cast is brilliant with outrageously camp performances from them all, but the highlights are the two leads. I can't think of two better people suited for the roles than Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. They both give perfectly flawless performances, filled with heart and humour and charisma. Will Ferrell is a scene-stealer with some hilarious comedy as you'd expect, and America Ferrera delivers a great performance with a lot of heart.The visuals are so fun from the sets through to the costumes. It is such a vibrant and colourful film that bursts with creativity, and to top it all off it has a superb soundtrack as well.If you were once a Barbie movie sceptic like me, then think again as it does not disappoint!0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"The wait was worth it.gianmarcocibella21 July 2023It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.3 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Layered, Bold, Smart, and most importantly, Funnyishraqrasif20 July 2023Barbie is a fantastic movie, it's so layered, bold and smart. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, costumes and set design wow. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing in it. Also America Ferrera, what a performance (her monologue in one scene has us gagged in the cinema).Greta Gerwig created a clever, charming and fun movie that will have you laugh, smile and clap. It will also have you thinking about our individual role and place in the world. A breath of fresh air in the world of cinema and one that is needed for these challenging times we're in.Margot Robbie as Barbie was like she was born to play the role. But still, imo Ken(played by literally me) stole the show.A solid 8.12 out of 65 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
Good jokes and a disappointing Endingadibshahriar23 July 2023At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6
"Changed mesabrinahirleman21 July 2023Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. 💕17 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
The Lego Movie but for femalesmasontullis22 July 2023Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.Barbie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm just going to get into what I didn't like. Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all. But I didn't hate it and Ryan Gosling gets a 💯.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6

"Did we watch the same movie?dnkqbzw22 July 2023I found Barbie to be funny, self-deprecating, intelligent and masterfully pretty. The choice of making Barbieworld feel plastic adds an incredible layer of humor to it all.Gosling, Margot Robbie and cast are a charming ensemble of top tier performers giving their all and it shows. Robbie's self-serious approach to Barbie makes Gosling's self-seriousness as Ken even funnier.When I left Barbie, all I could think is ""This movie is SO PG-13"" in the best way possible. It's sexless, while also acknowledging sex and physical attraction. It's crude without raunchy language. It's self-deprecating humor is second to none. It's absurdist humor is uniquely millennial/Gen Z. I found this film hilarious and fun.I recommend everyone watches this and also doesn't take it too seriously.2 out of 10 found this helpful.

"My opiniondxq-1548526 July 2023The film is straightforward and innovative. Straightness, because it does not conceal, highly academic and personal emotional views of the dialogue and monologue, as well as impact, highly purposeful close-up of the social landscape. It is innovative because under its careless surface, the film depicts the plight and awakening of men and women in this world under traditional values. Different from the Chinese film ""Better Man"", it shows an understanding of the different psychological characteristics of men and women, and is more compassionate and emotional. The ""Better man"" is only limited to the surface of social issues, but this movie also expressed their in-depth views and vision. That resonates with the general public, not just women.First, the film is always straightforward, second, the artistic conception is complex and the brushstrokes are shallow, which really contradicts my values. Therefore, I did not have any clear ideas and profound emotional experience when I just watched it, and even after returning home, I could not make a complete analysis, so I can only start from the overall situation when writing film reviews, which may be regarded as the objective shortcomings of the film. Although ""Barbie"" is not what I expected to use the story to speak for itself, in hindsight it is a pretty good piece of work. (Better than the better man next door anyway)1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",M
"Its Good but not Great!Boskjoss22 July 2023I went in there with O expectations, but boy, it was cunning and audacious to say the least! It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!Barbie speaks to alot of women and MEN about feminism, patriarchy, consumerism and existentialism in its own weird, sometimes cringe but mostly funny way.Full Marks for Casting. Top to toe perfect casting for Barbie and Ken. But movié is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwise.Totally skippable in the theatres.

"""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10 this year.s-70262-0896119 July 2023""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let's hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie.52 out of 191 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Nothing short of brilliant - could be a game-changerStay_away_from_the_Metropol23 July 2023Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.Choosing to make ""facade"" one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer/director Greta Gerwig could have done, because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience. Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and ""reality"", I felt as if I traversed through 5 or 6 different dimensions throughout the course of the film. The movie has so many layers, I'm not even sure how Gerwig made it work - maybe it was luck, maybe it was an incredibly talented cast & crew, or maybe she's just a genius.What's most important is that the movie is hilarious, all the way through. There weren't many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face. Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as cliche, all of them murdered the game with their characters, that being Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. But, it's Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film. Of course, it's the brilliant writing that allows it, but Gosling's commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond-level. The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight-guy masculinity and gayness, as both a joke and an astute observation, is incredible and done in a way I've never seen pulled off before.It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone-headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in, is a script that actually has something to say, from the heart and from the brain. I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics, but I didn't expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy. At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE, but in a GOOD WAY. Though most of the film is full of laughs, it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. I think a lot of people had to get over an ""am I about to cry at a Barbie movie?"" hump, but...I want you to know that you should cry at this movie! It's both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time. It's actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink & the laughs.And on that note, it's not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda, but it's definitely lame of them, and in my opinion, wrong. I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes. Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men, it pokes just as much fun at femininity, society, and the human experience as a whole. It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them. Plus, if you can't laugh at your own kind, especially when it's done so articulately, with so much love, I really think you're doing it all wrong.It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully. The soundtrack is also a ton of fun. But the most exciting part here, ""as a fan of the cinema"", is knowing that this is going to take Greta Gerwig to the absolute top of the totem pole. She's been such an interesting, tasteful, and likable multi-faceted presence, between acting, writing, and directing, and I'm very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this.0 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Big mix of testosterone and oestrogenthaomytran-2106819 July 2023Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot.

"One of a kind movieoscarg1821 July 2023Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie.11 out of 48 found this helpful.

"Fabulously donemc-1463320 July 2023So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life.31 out of 99 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie Movie does give an Identity to Barbie of GenZmaggicmanch22 July 2023""I want to do the imagining. I don't want to be the idea."".When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn't believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I'm guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie's version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a ""don't eat"" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao's crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie's excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken's masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken's changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie's attempt to appease Ken's manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted ""gender war"" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn't great.Both Margot's and Ryan's performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film's direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.To end with my favourite line by Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: ""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever."" The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven't seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it's easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z's pragmatic thinking.1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Greta did it!moviesbio24 July 2023Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again. It has all the makings of a classic and a cult film.10 out of 56 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it's rated PG-13 and it's kinda hilarious.I hope there's a second movie... Barbie and The Rockers!!!!5 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Fantastic movie!!!marcecclefield23 July 2023Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Visually appealing but 'meh'supaculechik23 July 2023Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Not family friendly or really enjoyableayanks22 July 2023I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them. The acting, some musical numbers and sets were good but overall a missed opportunity to make a fun feel-good movie. I was very disappointed.54 out of 85 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Dumb Funbmlchick23 July 2023First, lower your expectations and second, this is not a children's movie. Lastly, don't take it seriously.Go in with those three things in mind and if you have any sense of humor, you will really enjoy this film.It's honestly really dumb fun, along the lines of Anchorman or Talladega Nights. No, it's probably not as good as either of those, but is along the same comedic line and it is really funny and charming.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both hysterical and do a great job in the movie. The entire theater laughed out loud through most of the movie. The supporting cast was spot on as well.There was a ton of reminiscing happening in the theater. You could hear countless women whispering ""I had that play set!"" Or ""I had that Barbie outfit."" That made the movie more enjoyable for many.Overall the movie was really good. In my opinion, the only misses were, every man in the movie was over the top stupid. No reason for that. And I believed the ending should have gone in a different direction, but I won't spoil it with my opinion.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Barbie Movie left me in tearsimmauglydoll20 July 2023I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.And it sure was a very pink and fun loving movie, but I was not expecting the turn it took. It made me go through so many emotions I wasn't expecting to feel, twist and turns that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and the ending was fantastic to say the least.The Barbie Movie is everything I was expecting and so much more, I think the highlight, other than the amazing message, casting and storytelling, was when John Cena appeared.In summary, I'm not the same person I was 1h and 54m ago.10 out of 38 found this helpful.

"Don't know what I've just seenWestmoney23 July 2023So bad it's good! What a political/philosophical/artistic/stylistic/linguistic/directoral/musical mess! Who is this film even for? I'm guessing teenage airheads - the sort that happily equate a Barbie doll with the Nazi war machine, as is done in the film. Wow! If the aim was feminism, I'd call this an own goal. So whinging, so reliant on gender stereotypes and societal stereotypes, so busy sermonising, it achieves nothing. The reasoning behind the film's reasoning wouldn't stand up to two minutes of scrutiny. Who wrote this junk? Who directed it? Who signed it off? Honestly, I'm not kidding when I say it's so bad it's good; I'd happily rewatch it just to marvel again at the grinding cognitive dissonance. I'm looking forward to the IMDB rating dropping - already below 7.5.1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",D
"Great potential but messy closureramon-vermij24 July 2023Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose.2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"It's more than a story of a plastic dollarondolls20 July 2023My expectations were very low for the movie but I am surprised. The Movie was literally good, the cast were fantastic, the set up delivered the fabulousness of the B world! Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie. I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.Ryan Gosling, he literally delivered his best. The soundtrack should have some more elements from 80s 90s as the storyline mostly based on these years of Barbie.Paying a tribute to Ruth was amazing but they should have also pay a tribute to the original Barbie, Bild Lilli...30 out of 97 found this helpful.

"South Park episode on an acid tripPaperCoffins22 July 2023I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Amazingdakotajjackson21 July 2023This movie was definitely made for everybody. It had hilarious scenes and a few sad ones. And I was always told when a movie makes you laugh and cry, it's a great movie. The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it. The people that are saying those things, obviously have not seen the movie. It's just so good, I would be able to watch this everyday. It is definitely worth the money to see it.30 out of 102 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Let's Go Party With BarbieStream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews22 July 2023Welcome back, Streamers! The most anticipated movie weekend of 2023 is here. It's Barbenheimer. If you haven't followed it, there's this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer...In this corner, coming in at 11.5 inches, it's the iconic, blonde fashion doll, Barbie.Barbie is the first live-action film about the American icon and her place in culture. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote a screenplay, which Gerwig directs, that takes audiences into Barbieland, where we meet stereotypical Barbie (Marot Robbie) and her fellow Barbies living their perfect existences until one day stereotypical Barbie starts to think constantly about death, her feet become flat and other things are off. Barbie has to make a trek to the real world to find out why things have changed for her and to set them straight. Barbie is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), whose existence is so dependent upon Barbie that he only has a good day if Barbie looks at him. Rollerblading, hot pink singing and dancing hijinks ensue.Overall, Barbie is a weird and wonderful movie. It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into creating this story and world inhabited by Barbie. You will be awed by the clever production design and the intense attention to detail that went into constructing Barbieland. The colors pop. There are cute animated touches throughout. Additionally, the costume design enhances each Barbie and Ken in interesting ways. You'll also notice the music throughout the film is sometimes poignant and sometimes hilarious, especially when it involves the Kens. From top to bottom, the crafts in this movie are top notch and worthy of a trip to the big screen.The cast, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are excellent. Robbie brings sensitivity and heart to Barbie. She's thoughtful and kind while also being naive and troubled by her own existence. It is a tricky performance to pull off and Robbie is great. Ken is an iconic performance for Gosling. He pulls out all of the stops to bring Ken to life. I can't imagine another actor being as successful in this role. Gosling is a really gifted comedic actor as evidenced by this performance. I'll also note that Kate McKinnon, American Ferrar, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Michael Cera and Issa Rae each have good moments as well. It's a big cast, but some of the smaller roles do get chances to shine.The main issue is that the messaging is so heavy-handed. There is a lot to unpack about Barbie's place in society. What does she represent to women and girls? What does she represent to men? There are themes of feminism, patriarchy, and corporate greed. The film does its best to address its issues in a clever and subversive way, but it veers into becoming patronizing at times rather than funny and satirical. The performances of the actors really carry the film across the finish line despite how it handles its themes.Ultimately, Barbie is a movie worthy of a trip to the theater. It is funny and even clever at times. The messaging of the movie gets heavy-handed and some of the subversive fun is lost in those moments. Nevertheless, Gosling and Robbie fully commit to their characters as does the large ensemble; and the production design and music are top notch. You won't be disappointed with a big box of popcorn. You decide if you want to wear hot pink like everyone else.0 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Barbie is catchy, fun, important and... that's it.eduardomelorocha-3496323 July 2023Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!Barbie offers almost 120 minutes of fun, captivating and fluid moments. Mixing real elements with ""drawn"" scenarios, it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way, varying between ""cartoons"" and the real world.It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives, such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property, as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender. A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn't exploit all of his acting skills. Don't get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!And my first negative point is precisely that. The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that ""Barbie"" provided, such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women. Furthermore, the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer!The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations, the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest, as the construction even them felt lazy. It's as if they didn't connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere. It's a shame, because there are really good speeches!Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there's no ""but""! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger ""statement"" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!In short, it's a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to ""pass the time and have fun"" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"Started good, then turned into a lecturevrg-7639523 July 2023I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.I could've been a great movie. A 10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time.8 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"Surprisingly Great!tfpdbbxck25 July 2023I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more. Overall 10, great message, great acting, great movie.5 out of 21 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"A movie for everyone (yes, even men)sustylery23 July 2023I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general. Who would have thought a movie about Barbie could do such things?10 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"BarbieIceCream-5722 July 2023I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Spoiler-Free Unbiased Reviewtrevormdm23 July 2023Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the ""stereotypical Barbie"" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn't take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it's rather comical than anything.The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding ""high societal job responsibilities,"" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn't true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother's are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it's just almost always cringe I guess?TLDR; ""Barbie"" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.7.3.0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7

"Let's go Barbie! And Ken is a Tenmohnomachado25 July 2023I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.1 out of 13 found this helpful.

"Barbie is a pretty fun movie to watch and worth the hype.paperman-4925021 July 2023As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.Honestly, I didn't get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it's origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . .2 out of 22 found this helpful.

"Started goodmichela-5405124 July 2023The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.13 out of 19 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Laugh, Reflect, Repeat: Exploring the Wonders of 'Barbie'sanadalsalt27 July 2023Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, ""Barbie"" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig's direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It's remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets ""Barbie"" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie's existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie's identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let's not forget Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie's Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that ""Barbie"" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie's mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Barbie"" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie."" Trust me, you won't be disappointed!0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie!!!jonesjackson-2398722 July 2023There was a lot of hype leading up to this movie, because of the cast and simply because it's a movie about Barbie. This movie 100% backed up it's hype. This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it. Ryan Gosling stole the show and cracked up the audience basically every-time he appeared on the screen (along with Will Ferrell of course) Margot Robbie did a phenomenal job as Barbie. Overall it was an amazing watch and no reason this movie should receive any hate!2 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Somehow... It worked!mfabianovaa26 July 2023Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is the film we need right nowparksiet26 July 2023I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

It was sooooo dang hilarious!!!I love the silliness, aesthetics and nostalgia of it all plus the laughs just kept on coming. Of course they had to build a story so there were a few long monologues but there were soooo many laugh out loud moments throughout the whole movie.Also, Lets talk about Ryan Gosling...Who knew he was so funny.. He killed it as Ken! I was not expecting him to be so good. I will definitely be going back to the movies to watch it again...Oh yeah, BTW Its DEFINITELY PG-13 so I wouldn't bring the kids..26 out of 86 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Boring with heavy political messagingalarsen-8076922 July 2023Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.30 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Better than expecteddhanushsirohi22 July 2023Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.The display of patriarchy in real world using barbie land was so smartly done.A great direction with attention to details that makes this so much fun to watch.Some of the moments will make you burst out laughing and some will make you really emotional.It's a movie for every age group but absolutely a must watch for teenagers.My fiancé watched it with me who doesn't know anything about barbies but has a wonderful time. He rated it 8 so that's quite a lot.Enjoy.3 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,1
"A mature take on Barbiemlnicholson25 July 2023The latest installment in the Barbie movie franchise takes an unexpected turn, veering away from the child-friendly themes that fans have come to expect. In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.While this plotline may spark debate and offer an occasion for intellectual discourse, it's crucial to remember the intended audience of such movies. Given its 12A certificate, this film should not be regarded as a children's movie. Parents expecting lighthearted entertainment may be caught off-guard when sitting down with their young ones.For those who are able to appreciate its more mature themes and humour, moments of levity can be found. However, with a slow beginning that only picks up halfway through, some viewers may struggle to maintain interest. Furthermore, the film's rushed conclusion leaves much to be desired and falls short in satisfying fans' craving for a cohesive storyline.Potential audience members should weigh whether the departure from traditional child-oriented content is worth viewing or not.In summary, while this unique approach to a Barbie movie has its merits, it should be approached with caution by parents of younger children due to its mature themes and occasional tedium.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"A great deal of fun, and kinda profound toogreenariansoon24 July 2023This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.Based on how the movie was marketed, I was 100% expecting to be pondering the question, ""what does it mean to exist?"" by the end. Well, the movie pondered the question, came to a conclusion, and then told me what that conclusion was in a way that was very clear and easy to understand. Personally, I like when a movie isn't exactly clear. I like when I have to dig a little, think about it, discuss it with other people. With Barbie, I felt no need for that. The message was crystal clear. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it was just a little too on the nose for my taste.All in all, a super fun watch. I saw this with my family. We bought popcorn, milkshakes, and it was a great time.4 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"For the whole familyfaithhawkinscrump20 July 2023Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!10 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"One for the Identity Lost Generationlukell-9615522 July 2023Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.I don't know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything. The safe corporate mediocre middle ground is where this film stakes it's claim for your attention and money.Enjoy it by all means, if you can straighten out it's allegorical message, then please let me know.18 out of 26 found this helpful.

"Abosolutely the bestjasminegmrk22 July 2023Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!Greta Gerwig is the freaking best!! Looking at all the one/two stars reviews written by obviously male audience (or males who haven't watched it, just wanna express their fragile and insecure masculinity) makes this film even more ironic and a mirror of our society. Brava, Gerwig!Must take your boyfriends, straight male friends, brothers to watch this film, a good way to educate them or you know, get the hell out of the relationship while you still can.It's not just a simple film anymore, it's a sensational experience, a work of new generation. Maybe it's not perfect, but we need this, the society need this, the straight white male dominated Hollywood absolutely need this.9 out of 31 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A great movie for all grown ups and teenswalidoo20 July 2023I can only recommend to see this joyful movie with an incredible cast.If you like fun, creativity, colors and a great plot that is both entertaining and thoughtful this is one of the best movies you can see.Songs are OK but choreographies are amazing. Everything in the movie is weird but in the best sense because it is unlike any other movie. Ryan Gosling plays both a brilliant regular guy and kinda stupid at the same time, which is super cute and sensitive. While the movie is full of intentional stupidity and fun, it makes us man rethink manhood, not really because of the feminist discourse - which is a bit too much present here - but in more subtile way because of Gosling's character reactions and evolution throughout the movie.It is also a movie about American culture at its best : Barbieland is a reflection of America and vice-versa. The plot nourishes itself brilliantly from that reflection and challenges both men and women's conception of our dreams. Consumerism, business, idealism, self deprecative humour, all ingredients are there. The only downside we can find to this movie is the labyrinth style plot that is too stretched sometimes and unnecessary. More importantly this makes it unsuitable for younger audience. Thank you Mattel for this piece of fun !!6 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Someone's a fan of Warren Beattyreallosangelessunshine25 July 2023Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Pure Escapist Funanchitbaishya200423 July 2023Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbieland an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls, living in their pink dreamhouses with no exterior walls. Each day in Barbieland is a perfect day. However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to Barbieland to figure out who's playing with her and fix everything. Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she's truly meant to be.In this day and age when a lot of the movies rely on being ultra realistic and dark Barbie comes off as a surprise. It's escapism from reality and lots of entertainment is what audiences are craving right now. Barbie is such a fun and gorgeous movie that is filled with humour, heart, emotions and a lot of good messages. The production design and costumes are fantastic to look at and are absolute eye candies. The story is about self discovery and the evaluation of life however some might be caught off guard with the risks that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take with thier storytelling and social commentary.Speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie is perfect as Stereotypical Barbie but its Ryan Gosling's Ken that shines the most. He provides most of the comedic relief and is absolutely hilarious. The rest of cast does a pretty good job. Plus the monologue given by America Ferrera is something that everybody should listen to. It's so touching and talks about the challenges a woman has to go through in the society.Overall Barbie is a vibrant, bold and delightful movie that is fuelled by its star studded cast and flawlessly incorporated humour and though some of the creative choices might not always stick the landing, the good stuff largely overpowers the bad ones to create an immersive experience for the audience. Greta Gerwig has done it yet again.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"A fun watch with your partnerpedrochazbh23 July 2023Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood cliché.Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Pretty PinkProRedLion10025 July 2023Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer.5 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Strange but it has its positivesshakyblakey22 July 2023Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"It's absolutely adorable...tjnkxmn21 July 2023This was perfectly cast. I mean Ryan Gosling as Ken (I just can not picture anyone else doing it that well). Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.10 out of 45 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Is it really the movie of the summer?Imjustken0124 July 2023I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get ""fixed"", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie's plan of getting fixed in the Real World.Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken's character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie's house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her ""problems"" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other's personality.At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn't need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don't need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that's why Allan was created, to be Ken's buddy, although I don't think they would have clicked.Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously.1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"AbsurdChungusAficionado25 July 2023This movie has an absurdist quality about it that I can't really explain, almost like early 2000's Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander or Tropic Thunder, that makes you feel as if you hallucinated the whole thing. In that regard, another comparison is Monty Python's flying circus and the sort of delightful wittiness of the show.Barbie is profoundly silly and strange and an extremely high effort production, reflected in the spectacular set design. Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for the role so much that he steals the show. The result is that Barbie is almost completely unlike anything else you would see at the cinemas.I don' t think the film is perfect or anything, the ending, for me, felt a bit unsatisfying for Ken, at least, and the film also contains a car commercial, for some reason. At the end of the day, even if you disagree or have problems with the feminist argument that the film makes, the film will have you smiling like an idiot most of the time in a way that not many other pieces of media can.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Just ok - end falls flatjerankin121 July 2023Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.21 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5

"against the odds its a very good movie, not only for childrenkincseaagnes21 July 2023I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.28 out of 95 found this helpful.

Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!17 out of 65 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Get off your couch and go to Barbie Land!nicholasrhettlever22 July 2023Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out in some areas to have even more overall connection, but it makes overall sense. A little silly at times; but I'm not complaining, I mean it is a story about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Very clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"".Acting- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, There are serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may even bring you to tears (as they did to me).Music Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie music soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. Great modern day popular artists chosen, including Lizzo, Dua Lippa, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, and others. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-Ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1.5 out of 26 found this helpful.

"Flabbergastingxmaspoophat26 July 2023When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"Not for little girls. Not for anyone actually.gdin-3082023 July 2023What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.50 out of 84 found this helpful.

"Barbie delivers plenty of good, hilarious funHey_Harry27 July 2023As the film's trailer suggests, whether you like or dislike Barbie dolls and merchandise, there's still plenty of things to enjoy about Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on-screen. I should also add that Gosling delivers what's probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack Black's performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie.""Barbie"" is not only an eccentric, goofball comedy but also a thought-provoking film with a post-feminist take on gender roles and gender stereotypes in current society, something highly reminiscent of movies such as ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Down With Love."" On that note, America Ferrera's powerful monologue near the end of ""Barbie"" was on par with Renée Zellweger's speech in ""Down With Love.""While the above description might make it sound like the Barbie movie leans too much into polemics for it to be good escapist fun then don't worry, because aside from its core message, it's still oodles of light-hearted, hilarious entertainment for everyone to enjoy from beginning to end.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"There is a substance to this movie.jaroslavadam21 July 2023I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie, just as bad as all recent Lucasfilm sludge. I'm happy to report it is not true.Barbie and Ken have their separate, but equal story arcs. Ken goes on adventure of self discovery and ultimately learns his value outside just being there just for Barbie.Barbie's part of the story lingers a lot on the paradox that she is meant to be an icon of emancipation, but is also blamed for setting the wrong standards and gets some hate for it.There are also real human characters, which are compelling at first, but rather simplistic.The storytelling frequently stops to explore and explain too many messages about society, equality, misogyny and troubles if growing up and being a woman or a mother.The writing has some problems, bad jokes and the last twelve minutes are utterly pointless. But overall it delivered what it promised in a very nice package.The sets and cinematography are top notch, as well as the acting.7 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"On surface an 8, underneath a 10assiamdh20 July 2023Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.16 out of 59 found this helpful.

"It's beautiful.zoooooe25 July 2023This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Unexpected but so enjoyablealexmetcalfe-2901422 July 2023This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! <3.0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Brilliant film that showcases womanhood perfectlylizrgreene23 July 2023Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem.3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Better than it looksspiderfox-0903124 July 2023This movie was worth going to the theater I thought it was a good idea and there ware some really good jokes haw ever there are a few holes in the story and I feel like Barbie's personality was very empty I know that that is kind of how it's supposed to be because Barbie is a dal but for me I need to have a memorable mane characters. A other thing I liked about the movie was the opening scene lats just say it MIGHT BE Really FUNNY. There were a lot of scenes in this were the hole theater was lagging so loud l couldn't hear a thing. I also never played with barbies so I didn't get any of the references but yeah I think movie was decent.0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6
"Disappointing and misleadingenesmil19 July 2023The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.181 out of 256 found this helpful.

"Pink Magic!!!!!zimmalakhtar23 July 2023The most anticipated summer movie turned out to meet my expectations. The sets,acting,costumes,story line everything was pink magic. It is a very inspiring movie for girls but I think a bit too much feminism and toxicity.No doubt, the movie is advertising barbies but it's still a good find.It's light hearted and it kept it's humor throughout the film., even in deep scenes. The cast was perfect for their own respective roles but something was very disappointing for me that literally Dua Lipa's role was less than two minutes.Overall I think the movie is worth watching once in your life and it will be memorable. The soundtrack is perfect Dance the night by Dua Lipa was perfectly in place and also What was I made for.When I watched What was I made for on YouTube, I did not like it but in the cinema it was perfect.It is a great movie but not everyone will like it Waiting for Barbie number 2 now.

"Greta Gerwig Makes A Perfect Moviekarim_zarrouk21 July 2023I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.Barbie was perfect. It shows something that I was able to experience for the first time in my life: the artistic pleasure of movies as a communal and cultural experience. Although watching Titanic was one of the greatest communal experiences of my life, it's the immediate cultural relevance of Barbie that makes it a first for me. It's the best that movies can be. And above all else, in six years time this might be looked back upon as one of the best movies of the decade.In the consumerist world's perfect fantasy sold to little girls as a toy-the polished plastic world of Barbie-everything is perfect. Starting with Barbie herself. Until the doll experiences something all too common to the real world but inexplicably strange to hers: an inexplicable desire to die. We get acquainted with the situation following a musical set-piece opening of the kind that tells you you're in for a great ride! (A pleasure made double for any Dua Lipa fan!)As it turns out, someone in the real world (Gloria (America Ferrera) a woman working an office job at Mattel) has communicated these emotions to her. It's now up to Barbie to travel to the real world to repair the rift in the space-time continuum. Her typical but good guy boyfriend Ken joins in for the ride.In the sweet and softhearted comedy that follows, Ken and Barbie make their first encounter with the real world, where Barbie finds out she's only ever sexualized, and Ken is treated with a newly discovered respect that he never knew in the Barbie world. Gradually, he discovers the patriarchy. When Barbie finally meets Gloria and her teenage daughter (beautifully cast and great showing from young Ariana Greenblatt) after they help her escape a chase with the corporate goons at Mattel that preside upon the cubical empire, the journey is done and they happily return to Barbieland. Only there's one problem: Ken has brought the patriarchy back home!With the visual representations of masculinity in popular culture (pretty much Rocky Balboa), outrageous rocker outfits, and a great fancy of horses (I share this with Ken I have to say), Ken has now amassed all the aesthetics he needs to firmly establish the rule of the patriarchy in Barbieland. The comedy is bafflingly funny, and the subject is urgently topical.I've lately had the feeling that movies today weren't as important as they used to, that they didn't mean as much and like Quentin Tarantino said and I agree, ""they're not in the zeitgeist (the spirit of the age)."" This movie was right in the zeitgeist!It's thanks to a collaboration between Warner Brothers, Mattel (kudos to them for having the sense of humor), and an artist like Greta Gerwig that we're able to have her take something so deeply established in the pop culture and marry it with the standalone work of an artist and its integrity. The result is something I've never seen in a theater before.In a scene where Barbie is experiencing an emotional breakdown, Gloria transitions into a long-running monologue about how it was like for her to be a woman in today's world. I sat and watched and thought it might had been something a bit clichéd and worn out. Everyone had settled into silence. Then the moment Gloria was done with the monologue, there was a pause, with her and with the audience, then the whole room erupted into applause! I joined right in! What the hell did I know... When the movie kept getting more and more exciting, and just transitioned into a modern-day musical set-piece this time around, people were so with it they had to applaud again. It was a truly great thing to see. (US audiences and people in Marvel movies are known to cheer for many things, but this was a different degree of sincerity.) At the end of it there was a buzz in the room, like everyone had just been part of something special.Essentially you know it's a great situation, you have no idea where the movie might go next, and it keeps coming up with the right answer every single time. It's perfect.More props to Greta; like all the truly great movies, it's also very personal. At first it's personal in the relevant but quirky mention of Rocky Balboa and The Godfather as symbols of the male-revolving world-movies that she herself wanting to be a filmmaker had had to deal with as deeply cherished and highly regarded in the masculine opinion around her-and it's personal again in the ending, and what she sees as most cherishable about being human, in what will stay with me as one of the classic shots of all time. The shot comes with Margot Robbie's perfecting of the single-eyed tear and using it the way you imagine they would in the great old times of cinema, except it's that much better because the times are today.I've seen reviews (The Guardian) calling this a feminist thesis. It's neither a thesis (see Women Talking) nor a dogma. It's entirely cultural. And despite the story largely being a comedy about women banding together and helping each other break free of the omnipotent clamps of the patriarchy, Ken, who is an absolute joy in this movie, is treated to a delicate ending as well. The role was also a total gift of a role and Ryan Gosling was right there for it.It's also the movie's quality as a journey of spiritual discovery, confrontation, and self-actualization, along with the great tradition of the Hollywood ending, that bring everything together and make this a proper pop culture opus.As far as what this implies for the industry, this is the first time that we'll be able to have a strongly established director that isn't one of the folks who made their name in the 90s. This is not to say that Greta Gerwig is now going to make a Barbie every other year, nor does she have to. This is her Pulp Fiction, her Raiders of the Lost Ark, and dare I say her Godfather (wink wink). May she enjoy it. But she's definitely on my short list now of the most exciting directors working today, and someone that can carry the torch of great cinema wherever she goes next. I remember hearing her answer with Singin' in the Rain (1952) to a favorite movie question in a roundtable interview, and thinking who was this girl. Then I happened to see Singin' in the Rain a month later, and I knew that girl was cool.Finally, I'm glad that an entire generation of young girls gets to grow up with a movie like this available to them. It's definitely not something Greta's generation had, not quite. It's also a culmination of the last ten years of popular culture, which is why I think it's one of the best movies of this period. But it's also gonna be remembered and talked about for decades to come. And based on its feminist scope, it might be already one of the most important movies of the 21st century.22 out of 60 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Probably the most subversive movie I've seenziyutalkology20 July 2023Well, English is not my first language so I'll try my best here.With the complete deconstruction of the concept of ""Barbie"", Gerwig subverted every stereotype you've associated with this ""not-so-feminist"" toy. She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It's light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be. Just look at these 1 reviews here. I hope Gerwig will make more movies like Barbie because I need it, we need it.17 out of 64 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"So Much FunCampsieNP24 July 2023I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing ""Barbs"" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say, thank you.3 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Much Deeper Than I Thoughtaidandrain1524 July 2023Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline.

However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7
"Loved It!chloerosejury22 July 2023Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast & crew for a fantastic watch!12 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Nice scenographymusajasna20 July 2023Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation.56 out of 80 found this helpful.

"Heartwarming Mother and Daughter moviedebcrupi22 July 2023My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.14 out of 36 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Bizarrely entertainingyellowsub1022 July 2023This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.Also, Ryan Gosling is not the best singer or dancer. It was cheesy and over the top. I'm glad I saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service I'd probably turn it off as it was so weird. It's worth watching so you're in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6
"Unexpected well done societal criticismrubenkaandorp22 July 2023Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.8 out of 37 found this helpful.

"Exceeded expectationskeeppounding23 July 2023I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.4 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Come on Barbie let's go partyJEBaeza21 July 2023""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.3 out of 28 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Bait-and-Switch Barbiemib91825 July 2023Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).Full Review:I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It's probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn't want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.I don't mind social commentary but I'd prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman's empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn't clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that ""flips the script"" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn't do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn't face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It's weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don't want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn't be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman's (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn't overcome anything on her own and she doesn't change as a person. In fact, everything she ""accomplishes"" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie's antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don't root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.Then there is the problem with the movie's portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, ""Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land."" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don't see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch.31 out of 50 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie the Movie is awesomedawn-barnsdale23 July 2023I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!15 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie. The whole thing is genius, the performances ( specially ryan and margot ) are outstanding and genuinely really good , the direction is great and the whole soundtrack is fantastic. Final consideration : GO WATCH BARBIE , it's worth it.4 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"A fun ride!Diae_lamiri21 July 2023This movie was such great experience to live. It's a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to ""Free guy"" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can't complain.3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"<3magdalinalina-5444223 July 2023LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.I probably liked it so much because I grew up watching old barbie movies, and now it felt like Barbie has grown with me, especially cause the topic of the movie was very real in todays world.Going in before the movie I thought it would turn out to be just ""okay"" since I saw a lot of parts from it as trailers I thought ""oh I alredy saw it all"", nahh, little did i know. Those trailers are nothing compared to this.I really reccomend watching it. But there are some parts that are ""not for kids""(ex. Some things they say, initiate...), But it's just maybe 3 times in all 114minutes of the movie.15 out of 44 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Playful idea about the Barbie concept that gets lost in the messy story.movieman6-413-92951023 July 2023Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully.5 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Pretty goodamatullahdaya22 July 2023I have watched barbie since I was born, I've collected the dolls the dresses and many other barbie themed things. I know all the movies by heart and the songs and I love barbie so when I saw this movies trailer and the marketing I went crazy!! I was so excited to watch it and support this movie.The beginning of the movie was quite fun and funny, very colorful. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their roles so well and really carry the movie. It contained all the things expected from a barbie movie. The plot was great but halfway through the movie it becomes very serious and turns a bit preachy so if you want to take your kids to the movies to watch this, Id suggest not doing so because I don't think they'll understand much about patriarchy and sexism, its definitely not aimed at younger children (12 and below).I was hoping for some more funny moments and homage to the barbie movies so I was a tad bit disappointed not to see it however it was still a nice movie, enjoyable and a feel good movie.I understand the message given out that you can be whoever you want to be but it could have been slightly more light hearted .1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Best movie ever!yOlgainwonderland23 July 2023Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message.18 out of 55 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Love it. Will be going to see it again.IanFRobinson23 July 2023Barbie is a modern fantasy with lots of metaphors about existentialism & feminism, and how everybody (men & women) should get equal opportunity. The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.It looks and sounds great. Its messages are fab. It'll annoy the right people. It's a big-budget Gerwig & Baumbach film. I love their films. I loved this. I'll be making at least one more trip to the cinema to see it again, and it'll be an instant buy when available on iTunes.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Wonderfulinacarunderwater0825 July 2023Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I've seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I'm looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn't not ""sexist"" it's making a point, and people that have a problem with what it's saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards.4 out of 17 found this helpful.

"Like reading a textbook instead of a novelcj-farnstrom19 July 2023Making a Barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea. Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels. Here, everything is spelled out from a a teacher's desk and the whole film comes across as bit thin.I would not watch this movie again.72 out of 129 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Not a Barbie Fan, But this is a good movie!!!tnb-6651523 July 2023This movie is so good. It is existential, funny, childish, and adult at the same time.It is uncomfortable in the way that it perverts reality turning it on its head, and it forces the audience to confront the uncomfortable truths about reality that we have normalized.This movie invokes a deep sense of sentimentalism, hope, and the beauty of ideas and dreams.Also, can we talk about Margot Robbie???? Does this woman have Oscars, because she is so freaking amazing. When I heard that Margot Robbie was going to be Barbie I was leery. Could Harley Quinn really embody the larger than life legacy of Barbie???Who would Barbie be? Really, a white Barbie with blonde hair as the main character? Isn't that so stereotypical?????Well, let me tell you something. Margot Robbie should give a master class on acting. That woman needs to take a freaking bow and so does Greta Gerwing. I mean seriously...!!! Margot Robbie going from Wolf on Wallstreet, to Harley Quinn, to Babylon, now to Barbie.How does the woman embody two opposing emotions at once with such precision and authenticity????Well, enough fan girl-ing. This movie is awesome. It's a little on the nose with all the patriarchy stuff, but I think it needs to be. It's as though it marches right up to all the critiques it knows it will have and dares them to say something.It reminds me of something a man on tik-tok said recently. Men are told that they are supposed to be respected by women, and respectful women often go unheard. Well, this movie is anything but respectful. It gives patriarchy the 🐦 and reminds us that we are all important not because of our gender but in spite of it.Go out and watch it. Take your kids. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll feel excited, you'll dream, you'll empathize, and you'll believe.4 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9

All the niche references made me smile, too!!Normally I do not rewatch movies while they are in theaters but I am planning on taking my sibling this weekend so they can experience the same joy!I don't understand the people who are upset over Ken being an accessory to Barbie. It is literally pointed out in the movie how misogyny is a huge problem in the real world and they are upset over one validating movie. Unbelievable. Please ignore the ""anti-man"" reviews. This movie isn't anti-man. If anything, it's anti-patriarchy and makes fun of it.12 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Cute Summer Movievoakchrl27 July 2023Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second watch. Definitely not the all-enlightening and god-saving movie to the feminist movement but it does touch on a lot of issues in such a beautiful, greta gerwig-esque way.The Barbie-Gloria, Gloria-Sasha, and Barbie-Ruth interactions are so impactful for mothers and daughters. Teared up a few times and would have definitely full on cried if I was home alone while watching the movie.Ryan Gosling was so good at playing Ken and making the audience laugh at him, laugh with him, feel bad for him, get mad at him, and understand him.Margot Robbie is just overall the perfect Barbie.6 out of 24 found this helpful.

Fun movievanwierreinder24 July 2023I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.8 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8
"Now I am become death, destroyer of the patriarchyluckybucksproductions22 July 2023(Note: I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature. Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death. You would think these two films have nothing in common, but I'm dead serious - no pun intended.)When your film has your narrator saying the word ""feminism"" in the first five minutes, you know it's going to be problematic.Now, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist. Some of my favorite films have feminist characters. I knew going in this film was going to be woke. I just didn't realize how woke till I saw it, which was kind of a disappointment anyway.First off, don't let the cutesy pink marketing fool you. This is not a film for kids, but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood. For example, Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was 10, but it was really for adults. But at least it wasn't woke. I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads.Yep. I said what I said. It only gets worse from there.Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbieland with all her fellow Barbies that can do it all and have it all. The Kens are kind of just...there. The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling, gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie. When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality, has flat feet, and cellulite, she is advised by Kate McKinnon (one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie) to go to the Real World to find the girl who's playing with her and make everything right. Ken decides to stow away in Barbie's pink Corvette. Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems.My biggest problem with this film was the constant preachiness, especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World, and it never really stops from there. I resented Greta Gerwig for ""giving the game away"". There's a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience, in this case men, but I doubt many men will see it. It's like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext. That's what Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach should have done with the story. This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience. It needed to be more subtle with the messaging. I would have preferred a fun, silly, colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me. Unfortunately, that's the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days.However, the visuals were bright, fun, and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe. I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA. Despite the diversity of the cast, my mom was unhappy that she didn't see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken (even though we saw a white, black, and Asian Ken). If there were any in the cast, I didn't see them. America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina, but that wasn't enough for her. She does have a point, though, but we could be wrong and missed them. Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of Mattel, but I don't care for him anyway, so it didn't really matter that I didn't see him much. Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler.This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it. Plus, the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre. I get the good intentions by the filmmakers, but it was way too preachy for me. Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience. Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks, but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout, which is what Barbie is missing. I think I'll just stick to that film instead.11 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"I mean, Barbir is really an everything.Ae_Sutthiphon26 July 2023As someone said, this is a bittersweet pill. A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing, but somehow, it brought tears out of my eyes.I love it. I love everything about it. I love everything it represents: identity crisis, toxic masculinity, and glorifying the value of dolls. Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like ""Barbie,"" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.Some that I'm stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be. The overexplaining of characters, when they said everything they thought but didn't really show it in another way, and Ken's arc are not completely closure to me.In the end, Billie Eilish's song is the key to winning my heart. Man, that song and that scene are so beautiful.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"The movie I didn't know I neededfallenwthyou21725 July 2023This movie was everything I didn't know I needed. Was great to just escape from the world for 2 hours. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Fun from beginning to end. Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Such a fun time for people not stuck in the 1950'scristorey20 July 2023Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success.31 out of 95 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"A lot better than I expected! Amazing, with a bit of a stretched endingt-37410-8858920 July 2023I expected this movie to be a quick predictable cashgrab with as much stars as possible for the poster, it turned out to be way more. It has its flaws, but they quickly move past that.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. It had great social commentary, while still being funny and wildly entertaining. The design is great, from set design to music to choreography. It's a feast to see all those stars dancing together, and the use of color is amazing.The story was well illustrated, with showing you the message clearly, they sometimes straight up tell you things, but those things are well explained in the context.The real world part didn't stick to its own rules, sometimes it was complete fantasy when it needed to be, and sometimes it was supposed to be ""harsh reality"" which therefore just didn't work. Cliché's and tropes were sometimes a bit too much, but I didn't really expect something else than that. The end-conversation was a bit pretentious, and a bit weaker than it tried to be for me. I could understand that it hit all the right spots for somebody else. The jokes were great, and I laughed a lot. Loved how it looked like the lego movie sometimes.8,2 Well done.

"I already need to see it again!rlabraaten25 July 2023It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!4 out of 13 found this helpful.

"The most political movie I've ever seen.mayaaaaaaaaaaa21 July 2023I loved the effort with the sets and the fun outfits. I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie.I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political, I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie. After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waisted money... How is a family meant to enjoy this?? I can't see any 13 year old understanding anything they talk about.Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin.

"Not better than Oppenheimer but a fun movieIsak77726 July 2023I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie.I honestly think Margot Robbie is perfect as barbie in this movie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is also good. I think that because of the movies PG-13 rating the movie doesn't target audience aren't kids and there were some violence scenes and Barbie really mentions a lot of death and she has thoughts of dying.The movie opened $155M and I think it's going to reach $1B at the worldwide box office.The things I really liked some of the soundtrack. The soundtrack features Billie Eilish, Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj, Dua Lipa, and so much more singers. I also really loved the song Just Ken by Ryan Gosling. I also loved the idea of making this movie and the director Greta Gerwig is just a great film director from movies such as Lady Bird and Little Women.Some scenes were very boring but I guess it's ok.I just think that you can't compare this movie to Oppenheimer because Oppenheimer is way better.It's a good movie.It's still a good movie and my expect.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Sure, Life in Plastic is Fantastic but ONLY in Barbielandjanbrianbenito-4664724 July 2023The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.4 out of 20 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"""men hate women, women hate women""scarlettwilson-3585922 July 2023I didn't get emotional whilst watching the movie, but hours later when i looked back on how special this movie is for EVERYONE, especially young girls and women.I must have been 8 when i told my mum that i wanted to go on a diet. It's what i saw women doing online and i wanted to be as pretty as they were. Then i grew up and spent so many years being resentful of ""pretty girls"" who i saw daily because they had what i didn't. As a not-conventionally-attractive and disabled woman, i spent days feeling ugly and getting angry at other women and myself because i would never be them or be viewed by other people in the ways that they are. I avoided the mirror for months because i didn't want to see myself. I felt sick looking at my own complexion.It took me years to realise that every girl is a pretty girl. Men will put us down and hate this movie because they don't get it. This movie is a beautiful celebration of what it means to be a woman, to get old, to suffer at the hands of a society which forces us against each other.Gerwig is and incredible writer and director and seems to outdo her genius with every movie she does.8 out of 29 found this helpful.

"Enchantment w/ genuine emotiondspornakk22 July 2023I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. The ending is good and it's worth sticking around to watch the credits.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Bafflingly mediocrenwsquadron21 July 2023I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone. If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer, make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer, you are not missing out on much here.48 out of 63 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"what an amazing movieemanoelgustavo20 July 2023More could you want from a movie? How about Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Hari Nef all playing Barbie variations, like Weird Barbie, President Barbie, and Doctor Barbie. Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse. The film focuses on what happens when the perfect doll has an existential crisis, and Mattel's pursuit to stop Barbie from changing the real world forever. Greta Gerwig ('Lady Bird') directs a script she co-wrote with partner and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach ('Marriage Story').

"Smart, fun and touching!!! Okloreloreglg23 July 2023The first 5 min 👌🏽!!!Not a second of the movie looses your attention, it makes you think, laugh and even got a little tear out. It's full of irony and sarcasm, visually amazing. The level of detail on the toys, clothes, etc!!If you think it's just a feminist movie, give it a chance, if your smart enough to understand and read into the details, it will make you se a different perspective on what's feminism actually mean.I don't think it's inappropriate for kids however, they have to be certain age to understand the movie!This is already pop culture icon, hopefully opening minds in every generation!1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Such a sweet fun movie to watch with the whole family!cavanaghmabel22 July 2023The Barbie movie is a such a sweet, fun movie. And absolutely hilarious. The whole theater was laughing. We laughed. We cried and we all danced. But we were lucky to have the best crowd at our showing which made the experience that much more enjoyable! So I highly recommend that you go to a good area to watch it. The people around can either make or break the sweet experience. It has been a long time since I've watched a movie that was actually clean and fun. The story is so entertaining. And the ending was absolutely amazing. The writers did an amazing job and the cast was absolute perfect in every way! God watch it. But get in your Barbie glam first!18 out of 64 found this helpful.

"A thoughtful blockbusterdavid_jinkins23 July 2023Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position. When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee, she scoffed at the gender composition. Even though our department is half women, the hiring committee was nearly all men. I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it. What else don't I notice?According to the philosopher Richard Rorty, art is better at changing minds than argument, because it allows the audience to see through someone else's eyes and empathize. In the Barbie movie, shortly after he arrives in the real world, Ken takes a walk through Century City in Los Angeles. Among the skyscrapers there are men in business suits, and a guy exiting a gym nods at him. A couple of guys jump out of a hummer, and policemen ride by on horses. A woman assistant is shushed by businessmen in important discussion. Finally there is a montage of men -- US presidents, movie stars, sports stars, stock traders, Mount Rushmore, and the portraits on US currency. Ken realizes that, unlike in Barbie's world, men hold the power in the real world. Ken learns to sing the 1996 Matchbox 20 hit Push, featuring the lyrics, ""I want to push your around, and I will, and I will."" When the song came out, it was my freshman year in high school. I must have heard it hundreds of times, but I never noticed that the lyrics hinted at violence against the singer's love interest. The film made me notice specific parts of American culture which I had absorbed growing up without thinking, and which reinforced the idea that men have the power in society.The film will work best for an American audience. Not only would it had hit less hard if I hadn't been forced to reevaluate the messages underlying parts of the culture I grew up with, but another wonderful aspect of the film was its send-ups of American films and popular music. The opening to 2001 is ported into the wonderful first minutes of the film. A bit later, a character makes Barbie choose between continuing her fantasy life (represented by a stilleto) and learning the truth (a birkenstock sandel). There is a great musical tribute to Take on Me (I know, a-ha is Norwegian, but it was a US hit!), and a power ballad that reminded me of Free Bird. Later in the film, Ken wears a faux mink coat that I'm sure I've seen on Logan Paul. I must have missed many more.It is surprising that Mattel signed off on the film, since it does a good job of presenting the good, the bad, and the weird of Barbie over the years. While she started out in a swimsuit, Barbies were sold in the getup of just about every profession. Girls could play with Barbie the surgeon, Barbie the scientist, or Barbie the politician, and maybe imagine themselves in those traditionally male roles. On the other hand, a teenage character points out that Barbie has given unrealistic body and beauty ideals to generations of women, and that Barbie promotes unhealthy consumer culture with all of her outfits and accessories. If nothing else, the color profile of Barbie is pink and glittery. The weird are all the discontinued barbies -- including ""Growing Up Skipper"", a doll with inflatable breasts.I nicked one star because of the constant product placement and the milquetoast feel-good ending. That said, the movie is worth your time. After years of copy-paste superhero movies and CGI spectacles, the Barbie movie gives me hope for a future of more thoughtful Hollywood blockbusters.1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"Preachy, vapid, and disappointingharrymego23 July 2023I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can't tell you what Barbie stands for.In ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie's character is called a ""fascist"" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.I'm not political, but there's an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it's not subtle at all. Men are worthless and Barbie's unique femininity is problematic.The best thing about the film is its wonderful costume design and special effects. But sadly, that's about it for ""Barbie.""5 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"Mile-a-minute laughs, but with a message.chrismyates21 July 2023From the get-go, Barbie hits hard with its spectacle and wit. The movie literally starts and ends itself in quips. But make no mistake, there is purpose and feeling to the film. It presents its core message boldly around its character's struggles, and subtly beneath its self-referential humor.I could best describe Barbie as the inaugural Marvel movie of Greta-Gerwig-involved projects. It has a fantastic ensemble all-star cast with added cameos you never saw coming. Dazzling VFX and detailed practical set pieces bring life to the most plastic aspects of Barbieland. At several points it not just breaks the fourth wall, but blows through it altogether. There is no moment where it won't reset your expectation about what will come next.There are definitely characters and relationships I would have liked to see explored more in-depth in the film. Regardless, Barbie will send you home with a profound motivation to re-explore who you are, where you're headed, who you want to be.4 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Couldn't love it moreandrapreda22 July 2023This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did.4 out of 11 found this helpful.

"The magical connection between human imagination in the life of a conscious doll!iyahikhalil21 July 2023Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.18 out of 52 found this helpful.

"Bitter sweet movieolgakastritsi-8135922 July 2023Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.41 out of 60 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2
"It's a good movieqnzmnjkq26 July 2023It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.In my viewing people were clapping, laughing and crying. It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film. Not bad ones just some are abit longer than I'd like.Overall I'd watch again and I've never actually owned a Barbie 👍🏼1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Even non-Barbie fans can enjoy this!kjcvvv23 July 2023I am not a huge Barbie fan. I want to say that right out of the gate. My mom, however, has a massive collection. She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life. Knowing that, I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning.Parents of young children, there's nothing majorly inappropriate going on but you may want to wait on this one. While it's visually stunning, I wouldn't call it a kids movie. There are lots of complex themes woven into it that younger kids may not understand.Production design is stellar! In scenes where some of the infamous Barbie dream house is involved, the props behave just like Barbie toys do. It's a subtle reminder that the team understood the assignment & did not disappoint.The costume design is also amazing. There are joking references to costumes that were discontinued that fans of the toy line will enjoy. The end credits also do a great job of referencing deep cuts in the Barbie lineup.Diversity is on full display here & it works to the film's advantage. Girls & women watching this film will find a Barbie that looks like them. And gents, they didn't forget you either. There are also diverse Kens in Barbieland. In fact, I'm going to have trouble watching Kingsley Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as Gravik, because he makes a great Ken. The whole point is representation. Barbie can be anything. The movie does a great job of driving that home.The marketing mentioned if you loved Barbie or hated Barbie, this is the movie for you. It doesn't shy away from Barbie's detractors. Gloria's daughter delivers a scathing referendum on Barbie's impact on society. But later on Gloria delivers a monologue that had my whole theater cheering when she finished. As a middle aged woman, I related to everything she said. I didn't find it preachy as some have said. It felt heartfelt & reflective of what most women deal with every single day.It's fun. At times, it's plain old goofy. The dance numbers are on point. I don't know what I was expecting but I walked out of the theater still chuckling.It's okay to revel in the fun of it. It's okay to dive into the deeper themes. There were tons of ""Barbies"" & ""Kens"" in my theater, wearing their favorite shade of pink, be it subtle or neon. The fans are all in & even a reluctant movie goer like me can get on board. Lots of laughs with enough real world to make it relatable. One of the better movies I've seen in a very long time.No post credits sequences.7 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"A Satire On Human Species and A Tale of Time.andrejmicic19 July 2023The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties, colors, and making fun of stereotypes. It's all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the ""Real World"" she faces problems that modern woman has. Ken also has to face the ""Real World"" but does it in his own way. It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the ""reality"" and carry themselves with it. It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well, as i've got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made.Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself, but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie.Ultimately, the ""agenda"" goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message.The music and cinematography are very cartoonish and nice, so is the dialogue. The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well. The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development, and Barbie used that very good. Even tho some ""agendas"" are pushed throughout the movie, it ultimately sends a good message, and does what Barbie is supposed to do : to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are.16 out of 64 found this helpful.

"Wonderfull setup, with a not so wonderfully excecuted messagenenasarec22 July 2023The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of ""patriarchy is bad"" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is.

"A human-plastic semi-egalitarian worldASuitableUsername24 July 2023Barbie, with a surprising amount of political undertones, will probably be one of the most surprising releases of 2023.The movie showcases both sides of the coin, hyper-femininity and hyper-masculinity, with subtle jabs and character realisations throughout the entire film without becoming exhausting.It's undeniable that Barbie is a female empowerment movie but it's one that everyone can get behind.My only disappointments is that Micheal Cera got a marginal amount of screen time despite being the comedic punching bag, and it would of been nice to spend a little more time in Barbieland.Everyone will have their own take on this screenplay, and it might take a few viewings to understand the messages that the film is trying to provide to the viewer, but by no means is this movie bad.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"New conceptjuuljuulbees20 July 2023Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.In one word: iconic.10 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Good way of rewriting and reimagining iconic charactersCatTheMovieCritic27 July 2023The movie is entertaining, funny and it does touches on more serious topics, there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeable.The way that the characters evolution is natural and interesting and I can sympathise with a lot of the characters.Is a fun movie and making a Barbie movie a pg13 is a really risky but innovative way of representing this iconic character Is also really important to notice that the movie because of its nature is going to cause a lot of polarisation and hate, I think that the movie could have been more subtle on delivering the ideology but I understand why they didn't do it.5 out of 17 found this helpful.

"She's more than just barbie!ftyp-2562121 July 2023The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.10 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"So much funharpersislandgirl27 July 2023I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Not for me.truthisuncouth21 July 2023I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.30 out of 51 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2

"Hi, Barbie!bunlandest23 July 2023"" Barbie "", fulfilling the expectations of our childhood dreams.This is the first live-action Barbie movie adaptation based on Mattel's Barbie fashion doll. Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis.Shimmery pink in the dream world while Barbie and her friends placed lovingly. Barbie Land features detailed replicas at a specific scale to look like life-size toy dolls. The clothes, furnitures, dream house, and background of the movie set are all designed to look like the original toy. Barbie Land's construction almost entirely uses an enchanting pink colour.Greta Gerwig as a director neatly wraps up the complex issues faced by women in society in a fun and easily accessible way.Barbie itself is a representation of all women's hopes and desires to be anything they want, including the right to live free from violence and discrimination, to be educated, to own property, and to vote. In Barbie Land, women rule the worlds.Barbie's casting choices have a specific quality. Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling obviously looks perfect. Margot Robbie is a living doll, her face and posture are perfect to play the role of Barbie. Although, Ryan Gosling steals the whole show. Ken looks fun to hang out with.The entire soundtrack of the Barbie movie is very meaningful and upbeat.6 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"Watch this!poemanja26 July 2023""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)'s heels land flatly on the ground.Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it. Prepare to cry.1 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"One of the most real and complex movies I've seen.ysszhb22 July 2023Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Ryan gosling is the best part of this movieryfletch21 July 2023This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are. It's a waste of time for anyone not watching the movie Ironically, go watch Oppenheimer instead.83 out of 126 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3

Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters.

"Really goodfgbreyesus21 July 2023As expected ""Barbie"" is A lot of happy fun! 💕 Greta Gerwig is a director I've really come to appreciate & LOVE. Greta is one of the most wholesome filmmakers working today. ""Lady bird"" is my favourite coming of age story in film and similarly, I have to say right off the bat-this film is ridiculously hilarious. Tongue and cheek? Sure. Just exceptionally written characters also. The quirks between Margot Robbie (Barbie) & Ryan Gosling (Ken) are just magic together on screen.Margot is probably the only person to have played ""Barbie"" as she is so perfect in the role with everything she does. Mr Gosling (KEN) is eating up all the screen time and will also have you gasping for air at some of his one liners and facial expressions.I should mention that Issa Rae & America Ferrera are just so awesome a-swell in this world. Now! Having grown up in the 90s and seeing how popular the toys were, I was apart of the ""Barbie"" crazed era in primary school. It's really cool knowing everyone has another summer blockbuster coming that they can be truely excited about. Really hope that everyone can give ""Barbie"" a chance, because it has a lot of HEART.Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is nothing more then a delightful trip down memory lane, filled with what felt like a stellar cast and production value. Furthermore this film was filled with outstanding characters, dance choreography and musical numbers.9 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Funny and Creativemrdcarroll27 July 2023The voice over commentary in some parts had me laughing to no end. Most of the Will Ferrel scenes I could have been edited out, they were too campy and distracted from the rest of the movie, fortunately they were few and resigned to the later 1/3 of the movie.To be honest I missed most of the big name actors, however Rhea Perlman was spot on perfect in her role.Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling were excellent as well, with Ryan giving an overtop hammy performance that allowed Margo to shine as the epitome of what Barbie represents, future possibilities.Kate McKinnon was well cast and delivered flawlessly.A couple scenes were overplayed.As a moderately middle-aged man I might have laughed a little to hard in some places.

"Who is this movie for?kjreiter23 July 2023When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity.6 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"Wow! So Good and Right On Time!ritajeryl22 July 2023I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT.4 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"We are all BarbieKristinaGeorgievaBG26 July 2023Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Absurdist Feminist MasterpieceTheSurrealist21 July 2023With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.3 out of 27 found this helpful.

"Was way more than I expectedyxzgjnydf20 July 2023Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.18 out of 79 found this helpful.

It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes.

"How does the Barbie movie have good ratings? How?!kim_shea_berg23 July 2023First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend.

"One of the Best Comedies Released in the Last Few Yearsnnatti22 July 2023I went to see Barbie with the highest of expectations and it did not disappoint.At times the whole movie theatre was laughing out loud. It was a beautiful experience to share. And there was even clapping at the end.It does not matter if you are young or old, a man or a woman, this is a movie you will enjoy.Do yourself a favor: leave your judgements aside and go watch it.Brief disclaimer: it is Barbie. It does touch on some controversial issues; considering Barbie always has been a female stereotype. It touches on the place of the woman in the world, the patriarchy, etcetera. I was not prepared for that and I do have some strong personal opinions on the topic itself. That being said: everything was so beautifully done and told and funny I seriously cannot complain about it. I honestly really enjoyed it.1 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Whoever has a problem with Barbie being too 'me-too'-ish, has a problem with womenmkmaca20 July 2023Barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film. It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy.25 out of 88 found this helpful.

"Men are trash, but now make it pinksoftwatcher23 July 2023Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.Now, this sort of narrative tires me, especially when it's so cringy and on the nose. I was expecting true woman power out of this film - a glorification of all that it means to be a woman, especially since Barbie has always been the epitome of femininity. Instead, we have the same repackaged message that being a woman is a torturous, inferior experience, and that you must escape it at all costs. We have the same narrative that men are literal trash and that they will succumb to their basest instincts at first chance.Really, we have the same old, same old: ""Women can do it all"" - we cannot - ""Women don't need men"" - yes, we do - ""Men are asinine, useless, selfish, and egoistic"" - sure, like all women are, if we're making generalizations - ""Loving others by serving them is demeaning"" - serving others is the ultimate form of love and should be uplifted, appreciated, and glorified. Instead, this film shows women in maid costumes to make the point that serving others is h0rribl3!!!11!We were supposed to get a visceral reaction to this image of women as maids - and I did, because it was so artless, cringy, and reductive - and make the connection that the patriarchy enslaves us. What the patriarchy does is simply split labor. Men outside the home, women within. Is that inherently bad? Or does it simply make sense based on men's and women's distinct strengths, at least historically? We must question. You will likely have a different answer than I.I liked some of the messages at the beginning, namely that women are so often subject to impostor syndrome. That was beautiful, but then later on the film takes it upon itself to trample men to ""uplift"" women. I did not feel uplifted. I felt betrayed and pandered to, except I was the wrong crowd. It ignores the hardships of being the dominant sex: Being expected achieve, perform, earn more, lead, provide, protect, wear an emotionless facade. In some respects, women have it easier than men.When America Ferrera, whom I just want say I adore, was doing her monologue on how it sucks to be a woman due to what's expected of us, all I could think was, ""Yes. There are certain expected behaviors of both women and men. It's called basic public decency and decorum.""For instance, men are expected to be dominant and aggressive, but not so aggressive as to be frightening. Men are expected to hide their emotions, but not be emotionless brutes. If we started on this route, we could pick apart just about anything.This sort of monotone, flat representation of our complex human experience works well to get a crowd fired up, but it's ultimately reductivist. I walked away feeling like the director thought I was stupid.What I did like was the aesthetic, the much more subtle commentary on American consumerism, and the representation of teenagers are oversensitive militants. That's it.18 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3

"An important feminist film exploring identityAlfianKithara23 July 2023Never have i seen a film on the silver screen as loud and as proud of its feminist message as Barbie. Most movies half ass it, you can put the same recycled messages that are surface level in meaning and still pander to the male audience, cause no one's gotten the guts to actually give us a film with a story and characters that's truly for women. But that's just what Greta Gerwig does. This film wonderfully balances comedy and emotion, you'll be laughing as much as you'll be crying, especially if the message of this film speaks to you. A colorful set design devoted to capture the accuracy of playing with barbie dolls, a beautiful collaboration between several female artists, empowering the film's core of exploring one's identity as a woman in a male dominated society, and the talent of the film's lead actress, Margot Robbie along with the rest of the cast ties this film together into Movie of The Century.My one critique on the film is that i find by that end of the film it was a bit too apologetic to its male characters. While it didn't diminish the film's core, I felt Barbie's message could've been amplified far more if they were less forgiving as the film shines light on the double standard placed on women, barbie doll or human.Nonetheless, this movie is simply excellent. I found myself as a trans person who has went through his own existential crisis and struggle with identity coming out the theaters extremely happy with my barbie dolls from my childhood with me. Never would i thought i would find a film that spoke to me on such a personal level as many have.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9

Great film and unexpected .I would highly recommend for any viewer , I felt the corny dancing and the meaningful actions made for a great cocktail.I went with a mixed group of different ages and everyone enjoyed the film. Some found it meaningful and some found it comedic and slapstick.The cast was one hundred percent perfect and I can't imagine a different Ken or Barbie. Ryan gosling played his part superbly and you could at times relate to his character and other times laugh at his mid fortune and dance routines.Overall a great film.2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"mixed bagsjo-1524 July 2023I found this to be a mixed bag.First up, when I walked into the cinema I expected there to be lots of young Barbie fans - there weren't more than a handful. The audience was a real cross section. Probably the majority were females - just. People of all ages from a few young girls through to pensioners - with lots in the teeneager to late 20's group. Lots of people wearing pink.This is the first time I can remember since Terminator 2 where I couldn't go to the screening time I wanted as it was sold out for my two first choices (in the day time).I was expecting a high camp movie that works on both levels - young kids and something for the adults. Thats not really what we got. This is not a kids movie. The group of kids sat near us were visibly bored after the first half an hour. Its a 12A for a reason. There seems to be a perception that this movie is for little girls waving Barbies around - it isn't.The first half hour has all the camp stuff, setting the scene, adults acting as dolls, funny Barbie world-isms, etc.Then it changes when America Ferrera and her joy-sucking teenage daughter are introduced. It stops being so much fun. The central message of the film is then clumsily hammered home with no subtlety for the rest of the movie - taking the viewer out of Barbie world. Its message is also delivered inconsistently.The final joke of the movie does not hit home very well and seemed a bit unnecessary.With the above criticisms, heres the mixed bag bit - it was very funny in places. We laughed out loud lots, but seemed to be the only people in the 3/4 full theatre laughing. Its also very clever in places - like the discontinued Barbies.Ryan Gosling is excellent. Will Ferrell is hilarious. Michael Cera is good. Others are confusing (Rhea Perlman's character...). I expected more from Ncuti Gatwa - given he is the new Dr Who.Some very amusing musical numbers.It felt a little long. Would have made a nice 90 minute movie.2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it's not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect ""stereotypical"" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!14 out of 74 found this helpful.

"so fun!evaaug-6212722 July 2023I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!5 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"a gift to this generationcourthatesjunk21 July 2023For a movie about a line of plastic dolls, it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while. I've don't think that I've walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and I'm already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theaters.From the huge amount of artists work that went into making intricate sets that had the feeling of big Broadway ensemble stage pieces to the soundtrack, I can't say enough good things about this movie. Go see it, take your teenagers or your mom, but Greta Gerwig went and made something really special.18 out of 82 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Surprised but not disappointedloicjanssen19 July 2023I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the 'ideal' life of Barbie & Ken, as Barbie related content is usually known for.I was however quite surprised with the depth of the themes in this movie. The themes of gender equality and femininity were touched on in a very observant and interesting fashion, not necessarily pushing any agenda but instead giving the viewer their own opportunity to make their mind up and think a bit. Despite the serieus themes, the movie is very funny and gives a lot of big and small nudges to the Barbie franchise and history. It's remarkably weird at times, but in a good way.The acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is great, as well as by a lot of the side characters. The set designs are also amazingly done and give the movie a nice feel. The audience was very hyped up and clapped or screamed on multiple occasions, improving the cinema experience on our visit at the opening night as well.Would definitely recommend a cinema viewing!11 out of 50 found this helpful.

"A Talent for the Obviousinframan23 July 2023Just as they did with White Noise (based on a phenomenal book by Don DeLillo, btw), Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take an existing cultural institution which already possesses immense iconic satirical qualities and overwhelmly trash it with unnecessary hokey jokey business. (See the final supermarket so-called dance scene in White noise - itself lifted from a far better version in the final scene of the Japanese remake of Zatoichi). This couple should run a torture garden for a spy agency: they have such an immense grasp of the obvious, they will pummel your senses to smithereens. You will never recall when the Jokers grin of insane happiness was not permanently distorting your lips. What have we done to deserve this? You name it. At least they didn't cast Adam Driver as Ken.38 out of 90 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"I LOVE it!elzepaliukaite20 July 2023The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff.6 out of 28 found this helpful.

"Best movie since Cruellatheisensean23 July 2023A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes. Congratulations to the writer, producer, Director and cast as it was an amazing movie all around - loved it.6 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9

"A fun, comedically-awesome time!nicholasrhettlever23 July 2023Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out more in some areas to have an even better overall connection; nonetheless, it still has a great plot, conflict, climax, etc. A little silly at times; but, it is a movie about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, just about the perfect movie length at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"". Good angling on all characters.Acting & Costumes/Makeup- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, very serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may bring you to tears. The costumes & makeup were beautiful.Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1. This movie is PG-13 for a reason. There are lots of mature references. It is a movie made for adults, not kids. Definitely worth a watch, though, so go see it!1 out of 14 found this helpful.

"Great comedy with a positive messageLeemis24 July 2023Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over ""what's feminine"" or ""what's masculine"" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).11 out of 69 found this helpful.

"Meaningful and interesting movie😋t-6580421 July 2023Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.13 out of 58 found this helpful.

"No Way This Is A Good MovieMainecoon99922 July 2023Barbie represents opression of women all around the world ruled by men. Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...This movie should not have been a political satire. It should have been a fantasy romance comedy musical such as Entangled or Disney movies. I left the movie theater after its first 30 minutes so if this one didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the remaining 1:30 hour of its runtime I had much more funtime wandering under hot sun than watching Barbie...Robbie and Gosling are as good as they could get with this absurd writing and directing.My rating is 3 only for the sake of its starting level production staff, PA, Gathering servants who worked for minumum union wage.10 out of 17 found this helpful.

"Fun filled and pink!benprice-1352123 July 2023A pink lovers dream really,I sat down at this film with nothing but open mindedness and a slight sense of uncomfortableness as being one of the few men in seated at the showing.However leaving this film I was filled with a great sense of joy, a near two hour course of fun, laughter and adult themes to make this a great film. Could a child watch this for the sake of it purely being Barbie? Yes. Could an adult enjoy this and understand the true meanings of the film? Yes!Without giving any spoilers away Greta Gerwig delivers a fun filled adventure with mature enough themes to open the eyes of many film goers to see what is really out there happening in todays world and this a pure reflection of that formatted in a way that all can enjoy.A seemingly fully invested enable cast bring the life and soul to this film, Gosling seemingly carrying this film on his back and Margot's performance was also good enough.The cinematography and stage design for this was exactly how you would imagine and provide a great backdrop to this film, The musical numbers and art style were in complete sync boosting the film to wild heights.Some tough, touching and some frankly weird scenes (The very end) left me feeling great overall and its certainly a film I would see again and one I would recommend.1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Great!toriraphael22 July 2023Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Definitely Not For KidsAndrewmcal23 July 2023I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.If Barbie is meant to be a dark satire, it's alright. If it's meant to be a kids movie, it's unconscionably bad. And, I'm totally confused which type of movie it's supposed to be. What the literal heck is going on!!If you're looking for a twenty first century dark cultural satire, you're at least in your twenties, you've an open mind, this is your movie... maybe. If you're looking for a movie to take your kids to, before getting ice cream, this is absolutely not the movie you're looking for. My advice: give Barbie a miss and go straight for the ice cream. You will be so much happier. I wish I had.11 out of 19 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3

"This movie changed my entire lifeantoninawiecek22 July 2023I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Best movie evercadylily21 July 2023This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick).15 out of 92 found this helpful.

"Could have been feministic in a good waysarahsoderstrom19 July 2023With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.65 out of 102 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"Barbie for one and allghettofabtoast20 July 2023This movie was amazing both in the commentary it set out to say and the jokes. I'm not gonna beat around the Malbui dream house, the casting was on point and the references to some of the more obscure Barbie lore was appreciated. Ken also has some pretty fun scenes as well.Now listen I've already seen reviews about how some people aren't happy about the commentary in the movie. Well guess what maybe that's the issue then. We have movies about war but that doesn't mean we are saying war is good. Overall I think there are alot of people who wanted this to be a comedy so bad that they missed the very obvious signs in the trailer that it was going to be more then that. The comedy is there to soften the slap of reality that yes women are still objectified and they aren't going to sugar coat it.If this movie pisses you off because you think the plot is ""men bad, women good"" then you missed the point of Ken's story line and how he grew as a person. Grow up and learn to see beyond your 'Barbieland' where everything it's perfect for you cause it's not.12 out of 59 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Yeswesty-4731324 July 2023Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)*The list of gorlz is ever growing and may only be influenced by my opinion.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie. Brilliant.The conversations surrounding this movie is essential to have.I recommend to every single person. Greta Gerwig is brilliant.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Exceeded my expectations!leonardocedi22 July 2023I just saw the barbie movie this day and in a few words I can say that it exceeded my expectations that I had about this movie.First of all, the performance of all the characters in general is more than decent, and I also feel that it had a perfectly planned plot, since I consider that no scene is out of context or just filler, which is something that happens very often in movies these days.Also another aspect to highlight is that the film in general is still entertaining for audiences of all ages, since it contains humorous phrases and references that make the film more attractive to people.Finally, the main reason why I liked this film so much was that it leaves you with a very deep message, since this film touches on very sensitive issues that represent the defects of the human being, and this film leaves us a message that we are all equally important and that we must not let ourselves be carried away by society's stereotypes.1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Fun and heartwarmingqgyrhyt21 July 2023When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink bling bling stuff but I should've expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when it's a Greta Gerwig movie.And what even more interesting about this movie is when you watch this at the first half you would think it is solely about woman empowerment and stuff but at the end it really does explain about man's feeling and insecurities as well. The introduction of patriarchy towards Ken is such an amazing and fun scene to watch. Ryan gosling is such a good actor to play the himbo role since you can enjoy his character despite how he portrayed the toxic masculinity role so well.But I wanna focus more on my point of view as a woman myself here. Watching this movie as someone who's childhood revolves around Barbie doll brings so much nostalgia and make me realize how it plays a huge part in my journey as a woman. The transitions from being a little girl to a woman is spot on. It touches about insecurities and the man's expectations of a woman and many more crucial problems.It is so woman empowering and the message is quite obvious and delivered pretty strongly and straight forward in the scripts. But I couldn't deny the scriptwriting really touches my heart and makes me wanna cry. But i still wish it was being potrayed and conveyed more subtly as it will be more fun for viewers to interpret the message itself but I understand that this Barbie movie's targeted audience could be from all range of age so the message should be crystal clear.It's just some people might think that this movie is solely forcing an agenda. Like as a woman I get this whole messages but for someone else it might be coming off to strong and seems pretty stereotypical feminism BS which is a hard pill to swallow but we all know certain people in our society will have that kind of opinion when they saw the movie. That's why I wish it comes more naturally, thats all. But I think the ending make up the whole strong message about feminism earlier with how its was not just about that.Like I said the movie also touches about the whole experience as a human no matter what their gender are and how we're flawed but that's just what life is.3 out of 27 found this helpful.

"What a surprise!fleyros25 July 2023Go and see it with neutrality. It is not a movie exclusively for the female audience. I have fully appreciated the way in which certain topics are addressed, such as Capitalism and Patriarchy, the stereotypes of being an attractive Woman and the problem about the toxic masculinity. At the moment it is the film that most surprised me, positively, of 2023. There's a special chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, since, when they appear together in the first scene till the last one, and when you note this detail you cannot think : ""Damn, they're so gorgeous!"".Would recommend it!!!!!!0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Entertaining if a Bit Feministicbreathinglifehouse23 July 2023Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Fun but occasionally confused with itself.tompmcr23 July 2023I'll start with the issues, because overall this movie was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously.The majority of the movie is a lighthearted comedy. The biggest tool a comedy has to use for conveying societal criticisms is satire. The beauty of satire is that you can make some really good points. When the movie used satire to make it's points it was great. But the 5% of the time that it forgot about the comedy altogether and tried to take itself too seriously (I'm not saying the subject itself matter wasn't serious) conflicted with it's own tone. You can make all the points you want to make with a biting satire without stomping on your own tone.The ending for Barbie was felt misguided. Without spoiling it, there's a point between when the final conflict is resolved and the very last scene of the movie where barbie experiences something. It looks like the scene is supposed to be deep and insightful, but it honestly felt like the writers got to that point in the movie and didn't know how to end it, so they just kinda piled on some abstract feelings and vague phrases for a transition. Sort of like a high schooler writing an essay and not knowing how to write a concluding paragraph.The middle school girl character is a 1 dimensional character, but writing young children characters seems to be a challenge for Hollywood so you can't blame them too much. And lastly the whole car chase scene was a blatant Chevy ad to the point that it was almost funny itself.Now the good: The visuals and characters were all done really well, and not just Robbie and Reynolds but the rest of the cast. The movie itself was really entertaining and worth a watch.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"Funny, charming, and somewhat confusedbenjaminskylerhill21 July 2023Barbie is a film with undeniably gorgeous production design and distinct visual charm, and it's at its best when it embraces its surreal absurdist humor and runs with it. This has some of the funniest sequences of the year.Robbie, Gosling, and most of the rest of the cast have impeccable comedic timing. The line delivery is somehow both dry and full of energy.The world that the story presents is gleefully ridiculous and when it fully leans into this tone, it's wonderful.The problems arise when the script fluctuates wildly (and frequently) between goofy dumb comedy and heavy-handed social messaging. It's jarring and often seems to be treating us, the audience, like we're stupid.The script is so heavy-handed in presenting a shallow view of the world and reductionist view of both men and women, yet is seemingly so convinced of its intelligence and wit.A caricatured world is all good and fun, but it's not exactly conducive to making a commentary on incredibly nuanced issues.Thankfully, the film sort of figures out how to balance all of this by its final minutes, and it really does have a knockout ending.There's a lot to love here. It's just kinda messy in delivering the good stuff.14 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"A Invigorating Exploration into the Human Conditionnicolewarriner23 July 2023After watching the trailers, promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film, especially when looking at Greta's other work. I was not disappointed.I went to see it at the cinema with my partner the first weekend of its release, and before I had even sat in my seat I was already impressed. Over half the audience were families with young children, dressed up and holding their own barbie dolls. The rest were couples, older people, groups of young lads, and friends. The majority of the audience were sporting pink, and there was a real buzz of excited chatter in the air that I can not recall ever experiencing to this extent before a film. I think this is a testament to the entire creative team, to manage to produce so much excitement among so many different types of people is a feat I have not personally witnessed accomplished in my entire adult life.The opening scenes were outstanding. The introduction to barbie struck me on an emotional level, and perfectly set up the characters of the film. The introduction to Barbie left me reminiscing of my own childhood experiences of playing with the dolls, and managed to perfectly capture the excitement that was to come.I really enjoyed how some things were left unsaid, and your imagination had to do the groundwork. In a film made to appeal to both children and adults, often most aspects are over explained and nothing is left up to interpretation, yet Barbie managed to ask questions it did not provide complete answers for, whilst still maintaining accessibility for its entire audience.It had some really imaginative sequences and routines that ensured the film had constant sparkle. The choreography and set design complimented these aspects beautifully.There were really touching moments on humanity, feminism, society and relationships, without villainizing Ken (Men), which would have been an easy cop out.It was also oozing with comedic value, Robbie and Reynolds were hilarious, and brought a youthful exuberance to their respective roles. None of the jokes fell flat, and there were many moments where I was laughing out loud in the cinema.I will say that the casting of the mother and daughter did not feel as strong, and that there were some scenes of product placement that felt really forced and did briefly take me out the film.Additionally, I felt the film did not really know how to finish its story, and the last 30 minuets were weak compared to the rest of the movie.Despite these criticisms, I absolutely adored the film. A more honest reflection would probably lead me to score it 8, however, personally, the relationship I had with Barbies in my own childhood strengthened my appreciation for the film.It was funny, touching, exciting all whilst being really quite sad. I laughed and I cried.I would recommend this film to anyone, as I feel that all people going to see it with an open mind will find that they authentically enjoy it.Thank you Greta, for taking me back to my own childhood, and capturing those big questions that begin in our youth on the big screen.1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"In Awecolbiroy24 July 2023I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"I've always loved BARBIE films but I love this one more!emmysbubble24 July 2023So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!5 out of 29 found this helpful.

"Has issues but overall good moviealexleroy-3017822 July 2023Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better ""villain"" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a ""masterpiece"".1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Extremely OVER HYPEDcelebsentourage23 July 2023Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.16 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4

"Seriously campy fun!torichall24 July 2023I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie. Do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries? Then go and watch this movie!1 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Barbie with a life lessontylertubisjr27 July 2023I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world...agnieszkacieslakmatfiz19 July 2023While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one.8 out of 43 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The first half is great but the rest...thomasulmi21 July 2023I honestly cannot understand those rating on here. The first half ot the movie is exactly what I expected from a barbie movie; it's fun, it's pink and it was just a great watch but then (oh lord) the second half started. Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie. I'm extremely disappointed.26 out of 40 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Funny, genuine, emotional and pink.bcummi22 July 2023With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Movie of the year!!!byankabahiana23 July 2023I Love this one so much!! Movie of the year!!! Most men here will criticize and give it a bad grade, but you have no idea how much a film like this can touch the heart of every mother, daughter and girl who loves Barbie dolls in the whole world, it is moving to watch all of this, besides that final scene only serves to show the struggle that women have always suffered their whole lives and that their daughters and those who will come in the future will suffer. A film that sends such an important message is extremely important to us. I laughed and cried so much, was such a lovely experience, i wish i could watch again but this time with my mom.4 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Not At All What I Expecteddanils-9696622 July 2023My girlfriend and I went to see this movie last night on the day of release because she was so excited for it. Going into it, I had my doubts... I was pleasantly surprised.The attention to detail was truly amazing, the colourful Barbie World, the way the dolls moved and interacted with objects, the references to less popular and discontinued Barbie dolls.I thought that the comedy in the movie was going to be completely cringe worthy. However, the movie was actually funny. There was not any point that I felt that they were trying too hard to make the movie funny or anything like that. There was just the right amount of humour for a movie like this.The adult humour was a bit of fun too, fair to say that I did get a good amount of laughs whilst watching.Allan (one of the discontinued Barbie Doll models) was my favourite character throughout the movie. Though his role was fairly small and he was there for a bit of comic relief, he was funny and also somewhat relatable.I appreciate that this movie is not for everyone, that being said, I do think that there will be many mixed reviews about this movie.I for one have nothing bad to say about the movie, my girl and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that she walked out of that movie much happier than when we walked in.1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Amazing. Gorgeous. Stunning. Depressing.maragaik23 July 2023This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.4 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Mess of a moviekjc-3220523 July 2023Anyone who gives this movie above a 1 star has a vested financial interest in its success. This was basically just a mess of a movie. All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly...10 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Surpassed My Expectationsrdfcase23 July 2023I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Mature humour mixed with absolutely beautiful scenesUnusualKmc22 July 2023Barbie lives in a perfect world.When she discovers the real world, she realises that people age, have depression, family issues, and do not see the world as a perfect place that they want to be in everyday.This theme of Barbie coming to terms with what it means to be a human, with both the lows and the highs, is what leads to some truly beautiful scenes that make the room freeze. I saw the movie in a packed venue, a couple hundred people all munching crisps and children rustling and asking questions.During these scenes, everything was silent. No one moved, ate, or talked.As for the rest of the movie, it was great. If you're just looking for a good movie, this is one. Plenty of humour and the soundtrack is amazing, an instant save on Spotify. The dance sequences, especially the ones with Ken, are a feast for the eyes. The movie touches on the idea that you dont have to be perfect or the best. You dont have to be a lawyer/doctor, or a celebrity, or a nobel prize winner. There is nothing worng with just being average.The only thing stopping me from rating higher is a personal itch with the movie - the main part of the movie is Barbie dealing with a male dominated society (patriarchy) and all the issues women face in that. I don't mind the concept, but after the movie I wished that wasn't the main focus. It would have been a masterpiece 10 of a movie if it had focused on the problems of the human soul (sadness, loss, regret) and the joys of human life (raising a child, friends, finding happiness in the worst places) instead of ""boys vs girls"".Lastly, I would recommend a word of caution for any parents taking children to see it - it is rated a 12+ (at least in the UK) and thats solely due to the sexual undertones and jokes thrown around. Nothing terrible, but could be slightly uncomfortable.The hype surrounding the movie paid off, I'm glad I watched it.1 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"It isn't for everyone, but it is for me.alexandragarnham22 July 2023It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could've been easily disappointing, but it wasn't for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don't think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it's too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an ""anti-men"" movie and they will hate it for it. It's far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we're all Kenough.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A pointless moviephilipvalchev24 July 2023For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -> which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.For me this movie is just milking the Barbie brand. Great cast though! The sets, the costumes, the colours - these was perfect. And the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching :)So, should you watch it?Haha no.

People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.The full message is round up at the very end.I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.The set was out of this world.

"Pure Fun!kevinfaftine21 July 2023Barbie is a movie about Barbie having an existential crisis! Yeah, that's actually the movie. And it's GREATAll the Barbies in barbieland, believe that they helped woman and young girls be whatever they want to be and empowered them, but Margot Robbie's Barbie finds out that's not true, she completely looses it.Margot Robbie is fantastic and both sides of the spectrum, the stereotypical Barbie and portraying the existential crisis she is one. But at this point what can't Margot Robbie do, she's fantasticRyan Gosling is the real MVP, he puts in a performance of a life time. The ""Ken off""... ""Ken War""?... ""War of Ken's""? Whatever! That whole sequence is amazing, from the song, to the choreography. Ryan Goslings comedic timing is impeccable, and I love the journey he embarks in, and his ending, to finding out he doesn't live for Barbie, he is his own ""Ken""The production design is absolutely fantastic, every single detail is looked after, the costumes are beautiful everything in Barbieland is so colourful and so pretty to look at.There comes a disconnect when they reach the real world, that is a necessary evil. I say that because I didn't like many of the sequences there, but I thought every was necessary for the rest of the movie to work.Not every joke lands, but that's what happens when you take risks, the movie is hilarious nonetheless.It's a fantastic time and my only regret is that I didn't find a pink shirt to wear to the movie.2 out of 20 found this helpful.

Even the music is so nice with all the extras!This movie definitely deserves Oscar's,If you are a big Barbie fan you will understand the jokes even better! Especially if you are older than 30. It's fantastic! It is not really a movie for childrens, they will love the dancing and clothes and so but will not understand everything I think.So if you want to have a good laugh!

"Not even Plastictcjames-7405725 July 2023This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance. In the end, the moments are stale and require as sense of ""I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little, poor things.""The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something, anything, please. (Nope still don't have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).Most sequences of the film are a collection of ""unbelievable!"" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, ""I can't believe I am doing this."" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren't artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / ""provocative"" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.The long wait gets longer. When will art take a step forward? We have an American culture of business people (all greedy for more money, money, money)-very well, we lack artists!26 out of 43 found this helpful.

"PERFECTvenompool-6882626 July 2023At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.0 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Perfectionparkercblair23 July 2023The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful.

I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster.

"Everything I expected and more.lexilallatin-3136224 July 2023I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads.

"Way better than expectednicoleoblamski26 July 2023I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule.

"screaming crying throwing upbeezbog23 July 2023This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.With all this being said, it was funny as hell and my whole theater was dying at some of the jokes made 😭 they did not hold back.3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Not a KIDS MOVIE PG13teresa_wray23 July 2023About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.I told my human it was pretty much Rocky Horror Picture Show without the sexuality and way more pink. Not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time. If it wasn't so new then i would do an Episode on my podcast about it.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8

"A Hoot!missperea26 July 2023This Barbie script, IMHO, is packed on so many levels of thought - on were we are today and how we got there. To those who trash it, I say, ""Lighten up Francis.""Everyone plays their part uniquely and with verve. And the set alone should be considered for an Oscar. We needed this movie for the sake of sanity... too much politicking has clouded the atmosphere.To all those who grew up with Barbie, Ken, and G. I. Joe, I hope you remember that it was a time for childlike innocence to play and have fun.There is truth in comedy... just ask Aristophanes.Reflect on it.Note: The reference to Kubrick's 2001 (1968) is absolutely hysterical.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"Surprisingly goodyaacovn-2688921 July 2023As a teenager I kinda just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on Instagram, TikTok etc. But surprisingly this movie was actually really good. Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.When the movie first started I really didn't know what it was going to be, I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists, and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays, but this quickly proved otherwise. It had the perfect amount of jokes, (which were surprisingly funny) the plot was simple but entertaining . Toward the end of the movie it got really serious, and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person. In conclusion this movie was great and Greta Gerwig did an amazing job with the cast and the movie as a whole!!!3 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9

"Wasn't going in expecting muchkitlip-7293425 July 2023For a girl who grew up playing with Barbies wasn't at all what I thought it would be. I didn't think there would be a huge plot, and I was so wrong! The movie should be what every woman needs to see. Everyone in it was amazing and perfect (not Barbie perfect 😉). Had an amazing plot that made me really consider how far women have not come in life. I do love the line when a man has to ask for a job in the government and gets told he can have a much lesser job. I can not give it enough accolades. Everyone cast was perfect for their role. America Ferrera and Margot Robbie were perfection for each role!!!!Will watch again and again!0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Everyone over the age of 6 should watch itkda-3116126 July 2023Haters can hate all they want. It's a brilliant movie. I could not have asked for anything more. In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"hot pink cotton candy messexlana25 July 2023Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.Yes, i'm aware of the over the top humour, and almost cartoonish art direction is intentional. Yes, there's supposedly more 'substance' , than the style's portrayed. But the message is so generic, and only on surface level that nothing that hasn't been done before.TO BE FAIR, some part of it is actually enjoyable, and i had a few laugh. Margot and Ryan are great, but the rest of the casts is awkard. And the ending is kinda nice. Overall it's ended up being a 'meh' for me.5 Puking rainbow.3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"Funny, Visually Stunning, Emotional, & Engaging!baybaysulzy27 July 2023This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"AmazingFrizzabel27 July 2023I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.Genuinely one of the most heartwarming yet emotionally poignant movies I've seen for a very long time, and honestly the first movie I've genuinely felt understood by.It made me laugh it made me cry, I never expected the Barbie movie of all things to stick like it did and strike a chord with me. This is a movie that links directly into my experiences as a woman and perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be under the societal pressures of being a woman and the impossibilities we face every day. America Ferrera's monologue was incredible.Honestly, I'd recommend this film to anyone and feel like it's crucial that it gets the recognition it deserves. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal director and I can't wait for her next project.0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8

"One of the best movies I've seen in yearsjaimeematheson23 July 2023I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon.2 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"Incredibly fun & easily profoundbarragart24 July 2023I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Boring and comical (not in a good way)williamjosecastillo22 July 2023I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs.7 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Hopefully the way they delivered the message leads people to see the issues they depict in the movie.I truly recomend this movie to everyone who likes ""kids"" movies that also has a good message. The way that the Barbie world was created leads the viewer to be sucked into the world of Barbie. Also the references and homages to other movies and also Barbie sets and movies really sets the cake.A bonus point is that all of Kens lines in the movie is comedy gold and made the whole theater giggle a few times.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Great movie! Plot issues..but it's a movie about barbieswknrxjy27 July 2023""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.What makes the movie stand out is its successful use of humor and adventure that ensures it isn't just another kids movie, but a family affair where adults can also derive enjoyment. Furthermore, the movie is brimming with fun characters that each add a unique flair to the narrative.A major highlight of the film is the character of Ken. He isn't merely a supporting role, but emerges as a real scene-stealer. Ken's charisma and witty dialogue delivery is splendid, adding a new layer to his character that audiences are sure to appreciate. His performance has a certain charm that makes you look forward to his scenes. Indeed, he truly stole the show.Despite the largely engaging narrative, the movie does come with a few plot holes. At times, the story lacks logic, and there are certain developments that seem a bit rushed or inadequately explained. However, considering that the movie is based on the universe of Barbie, where the rules of reality are often bent, these plot holes can be somewhat expected and forgivable.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an entertaining and heartwarming film that successfully captures the essence of its source material. Its flaws are minor and largely overshadowed by its vibrant characters, engaging narrative, and a particularly standout performance by Ken. Even with some plot holes, it's a cinematic treat that offers plenty of enjoyment for both kids and adults.5 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
Great satire on present day societysamaunga-6840926 July 2023Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media.It begins with a simile of everybody's life that is Barbie land it is kind of our own sweet world which every human being prefers to live into rather than entering into the race of humans into the workforce and do the society etc and their Barbie and can reflect upon how different the real world can be from the world they're used to kind of like what happens to people of every kind I think this is a super movie too provoking people to think are they living to please the world around them or are they just living to live.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Enjoy the movie, feminists!lenikut23 July 2023Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.9 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4
"Amazing movie, by an outstanding director and breathtaking performerslegallybrunette0324 July 2023(let me apologize for my english beforehand) Oh my gosh... I don't even know where to start. I was very exited to watch this movie, and I decided to go see it for the first time with my best friend with whom I used to play barbies. However, I did not expected the movie to be so emotional: I cried in four different moments. In particular, the scene with the eldery woman on the bench makes me cry everytime I think about it! This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.Please, girls, go watch it with a woman you love, that makes you feel safe and let you be you, because this is an experience that needs to be shared with other women.It's one of the saddest movie I've ever seen, but somehow it filled me with hope. Now I'll go back crying about this movie while listening to ""what was i made for"" lol.2 out of 20 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Cute but not for everyonekedziorek622 July 2023Yes it was a bit preachy at times (the feminist speech that the mom/America Ferrera gave in the middle of the movie was out of place) but overall the message was ok and the movie was cute. I had some doubts about casting but Ryan Gosling killed it and Margot Robbie is obviously the closest to a real life Barbie you could get in the modern day.I'm not really sure the target age demographic either. I'm 17 and saw it with my mom and we both liked it, but idk it might not be great for super little kids. It's not overly vulgar or anything but at times it seems more focused on appealing to teenage girls and grown women.Also, Michael Cera is rad and probably the best part of the movie for me. His role is super fitting and it's fun to see him dressed all in pastel and pink, being a relatively normal dude in scenes full of Barbies.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Very fun movie!christinalishal22 July 2023This movie was everything that was expected of it. It was funny, feministic, cute, beautiful and everything plastic. It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist. All in all I really recommend to watch this movie, it was a wonderful experience in the cinema!1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"surprising and unexpected,NOT a girls movie.ashrafiaiman24 July 2023This thought-provoking movie is definitely not geared towards children or exclusively for girls; it's a must-watch for audiences of all backgrounds. It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.3 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Your future not-so-guilty pleasurextbyfbz25 July 2023Barbie is a really refreshing movie! Directed with a truly unique style that brings the Barbie universe to life, it tackles deep topics (gender issues, consumerism...) with a lot of humor. It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.The only downside is that you have to close those doors, and that leads to a more cliche/expected wrap up of the story that takes away some of the uniqueness brought by the movie.Overall, a very recommended watch and a guilty pleasure for years to come!2 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Avoid like the plaguevincentsheehan25 July 2023A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.Cons: It needed better editing to create a more coherent structure It had very dull patches (despite the pink) The emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick Will Ferrell was not funny in this.

"Barbie was much more than expectedcodyfelix24 July 2023Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ryan Gosling even steals the show - though every performance was spot on. Thanks to Greta Gerwig and Mattel for an innovative, thought provoking, gloriously vibrant extravagant movie watching experience. It is destined to be a classic.Even better, it has stirred up controversy that hopefully can lead to discourse on the themes embedded in something with such great entertainment value.0 out of 8 found this helpful.

"Brilliant rebranding ideafernandhaguedes26 July 2023With a production by Mattel it self it's an amazing marketing idea to invite, the critical young thinkers of this generation, to the brand. With lots of self criticism, the movie give other vision about the atual demand of what the Barbie doll always should be.The movie jokes with the patriarch world we live and also shows a subtil criticism over it with the ""other side"". Almost like - Equilibrium should win this battle.Jokes about the masculinity and the critics themselves, showing a child who critic the old Barbie fans at the same time as she itself is a ""Barbie"" of the new era.At the same time brings us, the main public (early 90s under) all the nostalgic memories of playing dolls. That should be soft but people are always trying to be something else.Great deal.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Laughing from beginning to endjuliadillon-1360624 July 2023I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you.

"Barbie is the worst and most evilnamob-4367322 July 2023Barbie is supposed to be happy, peppy, but here she and her world is the complete opposite. She might smile, and there might be bright colours, but underneath this is dark, very dark. This is also strangely adult with plenty of adult humour. Barbie is usually also about empowerment and be who you are sort of a thing, but that is not what this is about. Not at all. This movie is made out of pure seething hate, hatred of all that is good, proper and real.This might be the darkest, most evil movie I have seen.We watched this just after Oppenheimer, because we wanted to make a full day out of it and watch both movies. And we all know that Oppenheimer is not the happiest movie, with a pretty heavy subject matter, but this Barbie movie is far, far worse. Imagine that? A couple of nuclear bombs killing hundreds of thousands and Barbie is still worse...The positives is that there was a couple of jokes that landed, but only felt weird laughing at anything in this movie. And there were a couple of cute moments, but those only felt forced in there and felt false, like a shadow of what is really going on. The movie is also fairly competently made so I cannot really fault cinematography too much, although there is plenty to complain about there too.I would strongly suggest that you never, ever, take your kids to see this movie. Hide it from them. And to anyone who wants to see this, I suggest you put on a tinfoil hat and drink a lot.2 because there are some competence behind making the movie b.11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Very good filmalfiegriffiths-3524923 July 2023Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"One of the greatest movies of all timeannamrl24 July 2023I am not kidding, the movie was hilarious, self aware, touching, camp, beautiful, it was everything. My friend told me it was rare to hear me laugh so much, next to us was a couple and the bf was also dying from laughter. The ""this movie is not for me"" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn't your cup of tea but don't review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don't think they are bad. Why can't women, mothers and daughters have something for them? All those 1 star reviews are disgusting.

It was the first actually great big box film I've seen in some time.I should've known. Greta Gerwig, with her smart indie-film whit, created something for everyone. Easy jokes. Clever jokes not everyone will latch onto. Even physical humor to get the kids cackling.All with a great message about finding the value in one's uniqueness at its core.

And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play!

"A plastic product.erick-hernandez21 July 2023I thought the first half of the movie was hilarious and well done, but the last act of the movie is where it lost me. Instead of trying to communicate a message, it really felt like it was preaching way too much. Instead of showing, it tells you what to think in the last act of the movie.The only thing it has going for it is the set desing, wardrobe and music.Aside from tha the movie is plastic like the eponymous doll.The characters have no plot development, literal cliches.If you write characteres as abstractions , at least try to make into characters that are relatable to the viewer.Do not waste your time with this movie.93 out of 223 found this helpful.

I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not ""anti men"" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don't understand in what world that message is ""anti men"".1 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"#justiceforkenblackhelmetman-8678022 July 2023Okay I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny, it's charming, and also manages to make you cry. It reminds me of the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic years later, like Napoleon Dynamite or Drop Dead Gorgeous. It's definitely not for everyone, but in my opinion the wacky bounce between spoof and serious makes it wildly entertaining. This isn't a movie to take seriously, but it is definitely thought provoking. It's take on feminism and the patriarchy is displayed in a way that is almost making fun of itself. And I think that's nice, because the movie displays a message that everyone should be equal, living a life in a patriarchal society isn't great, but neither is one designed for women. Like The Importance of Being Earnest, it nods to the problems of the world in a comedic way, making it easier to digest.My only annoyance about this film is a bit of a spoiler, so read no more if you don't want to be spoiled (I definitely recommend watching this movie btw)Ken was bashed in this movie. He was treated like garbage, and it makes me sad. The poor guy didn't know how to be happy without Barbie liking him. The guy needs a hug and a better girlfriend. Cause Barbie was kind of a jerk to him in this movie. It irked me because no one would like that aspect if the roles were reversed. Anyway, watch this movie if you want to be entertained by a wacky plot and great underlying message.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8
"Rubbish movie don't waste your timeamandakelly-4432621 July 2023The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.136 out of 316 found this helpful.

"You don't have to love Barbies to love this movie and identify with itstarbuckmae25 July 2023I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Most of scenes have a hidden or deep mening, i am not going to write too much about movie because i am here to sustain Greta Gerwing and i am very grateful for her because she had the creep to made it. Maybe more director will do movies for our souls not just for action,adventure,etc...For me it was the greatest movie who I saw it ever.

"Stellarzdnkzf24 July 2023I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Half-baked script with an impressive budgetcincinnatihannah23 July 2023This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That's probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.The characters are one-dimensional, the plot was not developed, the themes are poorly executed, and the ending had almost no connection to the rest of the movie. Other people have mentioned the movie's preachiness; instead of developing the message over the course of the movie, the mother character gives multiple speeches to let the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think. What happened to ""show, don't tell""?Robbie and Gosling did what they could with the script that they had, making the movie enjoyable enough. The rest of the ensemble had no standouts, and the other Barbies were frustratingly identical in their one-dimensional performances.Speaking of Gosling, did anyone else feel like Ken had more character depth than Barbie? In the BARBIE movie? Don't get me wrong, I loved his performance, but it definitely felt like he upstaged Robbie's Barbie for a large part of the movie.Overall, it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't waste money on a theater ticket. Watch it when it comes out on streaming and form your own opinion.17 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5

"THOROUGHLY ENJOYEDmisterkayr26 July 2023Loved it loved it loved it.It's so funny, i was clapping, shrieking, cheering the characters on several times. The movie is just after my own heart, as far as the actual theme and message is concerned. I sympathise wholeheartedly with women's cause and can't thank Greta Gerwig enough for bringing this fresh new take on worldview at least on silver screen.Will Ferrell is awesome here, his unique comedy gels so well with the funny theme that the movie has adopted. Simu Liu, Ryan Gosling were stars here. Loved what greta did with the narrative. It's so cool and unexpected and refreshing and did i mention Funny !?**I was only left wishing Kate McKinnon had a meatier role and more impactful presence. Barbie is awesome.

"Very empowering movie!kg-1540826 July 2023I loved all the details and give major props to the director. I feel so happy that we have a movie that is so empowering and really well made. Their was a great balence between each scene and captured the childhood vibes I used to feel when I was young playing with barbies/especially adding the over-used barbie with the cut hair and marked face. I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it. Really if anyone has anything negitive to say, think first about all the patriarchal movie that exist first, and let us have one slightly feministic movie without starting ww3, thank yew :)0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"""Sublime!"" -Ken, 2023indigobrindley27 July 2023One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!Usually, a slight exhale through my nose is enough for me to classify a movie as funny but 'Barbie' had me laughing loud enough to annoy the whole cinema. It was jam-packed with line after line after line of hilarity - I couldn't even get a chance to catch my breath! Greta Gerwig's script had me snorting and crying from laughter, especially when paired with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's flawless delivery of it.'Barbie' was full of such in-touch and specific references that the whole audience could relate to. From the Kens mansplaining 'The Godfather' to the inclusion of Weird Barbie who'd been ""played with too hard"", Gerwig made the film feel highly personal, which is quite a feat considering the impersonal nature of the subject of the movie.But it was more than just a comedy; the film touched on much deeper themes of feminism and existentialism. When Barbie left the matriarchy of Barbie Land and entered the Real World, the film acted as a political and social commentary on issues surrounding misogyny and womanhood. With Gerwig's depiction of not only what it means to be a woman, but also what it means to be human, she beautifully and skillfully brought the humanity to a plastic doll.The set design, casting, acting, writing and directing were all executed phenomenally and came together to create a poignant, multifaceted and rollicking movie. In Ken's wise words, it absolutely was ""sublime""!0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Don't believe the hypeshhyaq23 July 2023One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Period. But since this site requires more than just that sentence, I shall go into further detail to save you some money.1. There is no plot line, and if there was one, it got lost in the garbage heap this movie is. There is no logic or reason behind anything.2. Moral of the story from what I gathered: Men make the world a horrible place. If I had a shot every time I heard the word ""Patriarchy"" muttered throughout this movie I would be able to fall asleep.3. I can almost seen the embarrassment behind Ryan Gosling's eyes for playing the role of Ken, because that is what it was. It is an embarrassment. Between acting like an idiot and then some random dance numbers, it made me wonder what kind of drug he was in to agree to this.Now that I met my limit. I will stop here. Just don't don't go.120 out of 249 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

" amazing, a must see, not just a ""girly"" moviesarah-8225727 July 2023I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.It is an incredible movie that goes in a completely different direction then I thought it would. I loved how they didn't shy from the perception of Barbie. Also, it was very well cast, the characters were all fantastic. This isn't just a ""girls"" movie, either! I absolutely loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. I laughed, I cried, I was entertained the entire movie. The jokes were intelligent and a bit edgy. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning. Great actors - great way of portraying silly messages and wonderful way of getting the important messages out as well. The movie had a great combination of humor and message.As someone else wrote in an editorial ""superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst of all things Barbie. No stone is left unturned and no doll is left behind.""0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"literally perfectflotreri27 July 2023It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor. But if you are a kid, you can also watch it, even though you will not undestand it a 100%, is visually pleasant!0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Disappointingly awesome film.vladlenf24 July 2023Had another look at the Barbie film. The first impression is undoubtedly a great colourful story of Barbie finding herself in the world. But if you watch it again, more thoughtfully, opening your heart and mind, I'm afraid you will leave the cinema devastated and crushed.I won't retell the plot, but it hides a horrifying reality of the modern world that even the authors didn't have in mind.The film Barbie, was supposed to be an ode to liberal feminism, but I saw a different reality. Barbie's character is not at all central to the story. The film is not about her. The film shows the dismal state of men in a society where everything revolves around vaginas (I'm not saying that, it's from the film). There the film ends with that, literally a vagina. But that's not my point. The authors, without realising it themselves, bring Ken's dramatic story to the forefront. It's Ken who wants to change for the better, not silly Barbie. It's Ken who literally changes his life through his quest to find himself in the world. This is Ken overcoming himself. It's Ken who is talented, resourceful, and driven. And what does Barbie do? She's like a capricious girl who just goes with the flow. She doesn't want change. She's satisfied with the monotonous course of her life: chatting with everyone and partying in the evening.Unfortunately Ken, in love with Barbie, does not fit in with her meaningless existence in any way. Ken ends up building ""his own amusement park, with blackjack and hookers."" Everything was great there, everyone was happy there, everyone was happy, until Barbie came along and through blatant treachery broke it again. Ken very accurately said then that in this world unfortunately there is only Barbie and next to her Ken, there is no just Ken. Just happy Ken. He was trapped in the idiotic world of vaginas. A world where it's proclaimed that all men are fools and women are goddesses reflexive about every fucking thing.Gotta hand it to the makers, Ken's musical episode is the best thing I've ever seen on film lately. Definitely on the list of best films of the year. Disappointingly awesome film.1 out of 13 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9
"A letdowntar_smith22 July 2023I was so excited to see this movie for months, even buying some of the merch and promotional products for it, but it turned out to be such a huge letdown. I was expecting it to be a fun, light-hearted, nostalgic movie similar to how the Super Mario movie was, but I left the theater pretty disappointed with Barbie. It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary. I did give it a few points because there were a few funny parts in it, and the set was beautiful, but neither of those things could make up for how disappointing it turned out to be.16 out of 22 found this helpful.

"Fun and entertainingluisjoaquincamarena22 July 2023I saw Barbie yesterday. It was surprisingly good. I think they did as well as they can with the source material. It's a little smarter than you expect they bring attention to a lot of societal issues still all surface level stuff though they were not discussed in a super meaningful way. However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining.

"So glad I went!jacanny26 July 2023When I heard that a ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it, never mind watching it in an actual movie theatre. I had every Barbie doll as a young girl in the 60's, even Allen. Barbie was definitely NOT my role model, and I am thankful for the live women who were. My daughter went to see it with friends last week and convinced me to see it, because it wasn't what I would expect. I am so glad that I did not wear mascara! I was in tears laughing yet totally moved by the message. A movie that is both inspiring and funny is truly rare. The cast and the message were perfect.

"Barbie: Beautiful, Bold, and (Somewhat) Brilliantthereisonlymatthewman22 July 2023Greta Gerwig continues to prove herself as a leading filmmaker in today's industry. In what is one half of the ""Barbenheimer"" experience, many would be quick to assume that given the subject matter, ""Oppenheimer"" is the superior film that makes you think, while ""Barbie"" is the film where you turn your brain off and enjoy the silliness. And while the movie is undeniably silly, it proves throughout its runtime that it's something more. ""Barbie"" is beautiful, bold, and (somewhat) brilliant.The beauty of ""Barbie"" lies in the sheer talent of its cast. Margot Robbie shines yet again, giving it her all in the titular role. By playing the stereotypical Barbie, she lives in Barbieland and enjoys time with her friends in her dreamhouse and on the beach. But through certain cracks in her perfect world that lead to an existential crisis, Barbie is forced to change and go through her Hero's Journey. Margot Robbie plays this role beautifully, showing the contrast between the Barbie who has a perfect life and the Barbie who learns what life is all about. She may not get any awards or nominations, but Margot Robbie is deserving of recognition once again.This film is bold, and that quality is personified in none other than Ken, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling. Throughout this story, you get the sense that Ken is just another trivial member of Barbieland, only existing as a secondary accessory to Barbie. When he joins Barbie on her journey, Ken is focused on helping because he wants Barbie to succeed. This changes once the pair enter the human world. Ken learns about the patriarchy, and realizes he wants something more for himself. Ryan Gosling is a true scene stealer, and should get award consideration. Gosling is fun, goofy, and shows off his dancing and singing skills displayed in past films. But when Ken learns of the value of men, he finally feels accepted and important when all he knew was to serve someone else's story. Gosling portrays this magnificently, another reason for Barbie's success.However, while the film brilliantly explores themes of purpose and identity, it falls flat in its delivery of a message regarding feminism and the patriarchy. Throughout the film, Barbie is described as a concept for all girls to look up to. The patriarchy and its negative impact is mentioned ad nauseam, causing some eye-rolling reactions from me. But Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who starts off a harsh critic of Barbie, explains the irony in the Barbie doll. Barbie is supposed to be the girl to look up to, but historically the doll is just capitalism and consumerism at its finest. And while it's important to show the power of having women in charge and the dangers of the patriarchy, the message is so blunt and preached to the audience, unlike the other important themes.""Barbie"" is a wonderful viewing experience, with the bright colors, goofiness, and dance numbers you'd expect and the emotional heft that'll stick with you. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are worthy leads, but the rest of the cast deserves recognition for putting their all in the role they were given. The movie is powerful, but there are times when it slips and preaches to us rather than showing us. Overall a great time, and if you truly want to maximize your experience, a ""Barbie"" chaser to the ""Oppenheimer"" feast is perfection.0 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

A fresh movie with humour and sarcasm directly on society. Watch only if you can handle the tone of sarcasm. Ending can be confusing, it depends on your view, I was expecting rather different ending that maybe baribe would go other way but it is subjective. Watch if you want to experience a fresh sarcasm blast on thinking on society. At some point it feels like the points are targeted at only one person but it is not.Beauty of Margot is really amazing.

"An comment about feminism, men & gender equalityhanschsolo23 July 2023An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers. Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place, but most importantly unnatural and unimportant.Why does a film about a female toy that kids play with need to comment on feminism. The use of feminism is to give a woman the right to choose for themselves and to be what they want, for example no woman nowadays should be a housewife if they do not want it to be. There are still current problems such as loans, the pay gap shouldn't be a thing, that is where gender equality is important, but Barbie gets it wrong and simply criticizes the mental state of being a woman and having it hard in its own life and still try to cover it up and being controlled by men. While I know that this is a problem in some cultures and countries, it is not the ones that people watch this film in. And Barbie definitely doesn't means it in that way.Ken plays the stereotypical men, he wants to rule and fulfill himself in his life, and he searches for meaning. His character development ends with him needing to let go of Barbie to truly find himself, and Barbie says that he wasn't created only to be Barbie's boyfriend, but truly, he was. No one bought a ken toy without a Barbie toy, so why can't we let the toys that girls play with, be toys they play with?Barbie sees the Real world as an issue because she thinks it only gets controlled by men, but she doesn't see that barbie land is a place which has a woman dictatorship.I was prepared for an fun time with laughs, but was rather left devastated by this film, because it tries to criticize how we treat feminism and gender equality, but then it gets it wrong, and finds problems where they is none. It rather comes across as the message, woman are good, men are bad. This is not the type of film that would inspire a little girl to be something special, this is the type of film she doesn't even understand or care for.7 out of 12 found this helpful.

"Writers were lost with this onekerembaser-0897423 July 2023If you want to educate yourself on patriarchy, read Virginia Woolf. The creation or viewing of this movie are horrible ways to raise your awareness about women's rights. It feels like writers were out of ideas an hour into the movie. The movie tries to have some sense of humor but hurts the main idea more than defending it while trying to make jokes about stereotypes of today.The movie features musical type scenes but both the songs and dancing is horrible. People discuss if barbie products inspire girls or force a certain body type to them, so disappointing them but no worries, this movie can inspire nor deceive no one.

"Barbie in two words: Stereotypical. Cliche.mfgkqwcx25 July 2023Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story.19 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Warning- this is not a family filmdaniju23 July 2023I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by ""mumblecore"" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.Instead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours, albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design. Watching empowered, millionaire actors, writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining, and I found it sad later to see all the excited little.girls waiting to see the next show, to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their Dads, sitting next to them in the screen!9 out of 12 found this helpful.

"A serious takeverycherryrain23 July 2023So my niece (12), sister (48) and I (male) watch the movie. Niece like it majority of the time for the colors and Barbie of course. My sister and I? We loathed it. My sister disliked it she missed that this was a PG-13 and being a mother hated the fact that she seen multiple kids under 12 some as young as 4 seeing this as they had multiple adult jokes and said parts of the body that kids shouldn't know yet until they are about teenagers. So warning for any parent it is PG-13. She and I also dislike the fact that whole ""storyline"" was about Barbie sad that she is flatfoot and has cellulite which everyone made fun of her and feel bad she was upset that girls whom are becoming of age shouldn't be showing that beauty has strong emphasis on everything. It was bland if you actually watch the movies and ignore political or social problems we have the story is so weak. Only actual part is when Ken actually tried to change a bit to stand out other then that it was basically everyone say i am ugly and I need to figure out I am not to make me feel better by showing everyone I am not ugly. Ending, and this is hot take, in both my sister's and my mind thought they were trying to say that women's greats gift or happiness is to take care of their daughter or just raise kids so we walk out of the movie hating it and thinking that they straight up made fun of both males and females males being show as idiotic meatheads and woman as I need to be accepted as beautiful and have kids to take care of. Their are way better movies that show empowerment if that what you seek. This just fails in everything well mostly everything music was okmand cast was great but overall just had themes they missed the mark on hard and story was just awful.

"Politics ruining an already weak plotamirparsanazemi19 July 2023Could have genuinely been a fun and cheerful movie except the feminist speeches and the cliche attempts at forcing political ideologies in a movie with a young target audience. Also, every man in it is portrayed either as a bigot or a loser, truly disgusting. I dont see how teaching young girls that the world is pitched against them, encouraging them to lure men and put them against each other in order to take away their powers and generally showing men as dumb and gullible is going to help us in the society, except to polarize us even further as we decay and watch our societies crumble. Truly disappointed.660 out of 1,267 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Profundity Sold Seperatelycraigfish-8602919 July 2023It's a Barbie movie. It is as saccharine as Treacle and as empty as Barbie's head. A pink spectacle, and much like the doll, you can try to attach some accessories or throw on a doctor's coat or any array of add-ons you want. However, at the end of the day, it's a cheap children's toy, that any sane adult should ignore or only look upon as some bitter-sweet memento of a childhood that they will never regain.Throughout the build-up to the release of this film, I was led to believe that behind the gloss there was a deeper meaning to it. Greta Gerwig is regarded as an auteur, and the script was said to be too good to pass up. In the end, the message was too shallow to be impactful, the story too 'meta' to be taken seriously, and the dialogue as stiff as the plastic that Barbie is cast from for it to be any good. At least we know who the Real Barbie is for, but when I left the theatre I had no idea who the film is for or what it was really trying to say. It's not exactly a kids' film. It's not an intelligent art house film. It's not a summer action-packed blockbuster, it's not an interesting take on modern-day feminism, nor does it provide any sort of interesting commentary on any social or political issue. It is just a boring pink distraction.254 out of 589 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
A rollercoaster that doesn't know when to endPadreviews25 July 2023There were no highlights only lowlights but that won't stop you going to see this just to find out if I'm right .It might have a different redaction from women - there's definitely a theme here and it's about the wrongs and rights of the way we've been brought up in the west with the American dream and the role of the sexes and how capitalist consumerism plays into that stereotypeSo it's not without its small number of positives it takes the whole film before aqua finally get a look in with a sample of their sing - the soundtrack is good and kens solo song will ring true with many menIt's not a film for children it's too complex for that but it's for adults to reflect upon the stereotypes in which they've been brought up with - starts with Lizzo and finishes well with Billie IlishGo see it but don't expect too muchBelow averagePad.

"Not for those expecting a fun slice of nostalgiasoneil1223 July 2023I saw this movie expecting a bit of fun with perhaps some moral messages and a few jokes thrown in for the grown-ups. Perhaps pitched slightly older than the pixar films. What I got was a movie that had me laughing in some spots while other spots had me thinking, ""what on earth am I watching.""I know Barbie better than you're average middle age guy since I've been buying special edition Barbie dolls for years for my (now adult) daughter who collects them. The movie did a great job of showing some of the classic outfits and play sets that would have been recognised by the fans so the nostalgia fuel was definitely there. Cameos from unexpected stars were also a treat.There were some legitimately hilarious moments. Such as the quip about N Sync which gave me a smile - given Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake's shared history (they both starred in the Mickey Mouse club show - plus the long running rumours about Gosling almost becoming a member of rival band Backstreet Boys). A huge laugh in the cinema came from Narrator Helen Mirren's quip about casting. The casting itself was great, especially Robbie and Gosling who were both superb in their respective roles.Other than the humourous moments, there were also moments that were uncomfortable or downright depressing. It's not uncommon to have moments like that in comedy movies or kids movies. In this movie though, they out-weighed the lighter moments. The marketing certainly didn't lead me to expect a movie that would leave me feeling depressed afterward. Despite being based on one of the most popular toys of all time, it's definitely not a movie that was made for kids.There has always been controversy around Barbie's awkward relationship with feminism. The movie attempted to address equality by showing a Barbieland where females dominated and males like Ken were treated unfairly. Then contrasting that with the real world where men dominate and women are treated unfairly. It's a legitimate message and I expected it to build up to a conclusion showing that neither should be the case and everyone should be equal. They attempted that, but pretty much glossed over it before rushing on to the ending which was one of the film's biggest ??? Moments. The speeches about patriarchy were valid but were also dragged out repeatedly over the last half of the film in such a heavy handed manner that many would have tuned out from that message. Meanwhile, any attempt at promoting equality was undermined by every single man I remember in the film being portrayed as adorably failing at being macho, or completely stupid. In most cases both. Of course the barbies were barbies but the real world women were portrayed as being regular, intelligent women. Not cartoonish buffoons like all the men were.On balance, I can now understand all the comparisons between this movie an Oppenheimer. The difference is that your average viewer would watch Oppenheimer expecting a lot of it to feel oppressive and depressing.3 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Good acting but poor storylineksl9309023 July 2023If it matters for an age perspective, I'm 32. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was disappointing. The actors did a good job with what they were given, and the Barbieland costumes and set design were great. But it was a poor storyline. Being a comedy, there were only about 3 moments that I found funny. I noticed the audience in the theater didn't laugh much either. I think the advertising for this was better than the actual film. The media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews. But it's definitely not worth the hype. I know I won't ever watch this movie again.9 out of 13 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"Cute, but limiting in scopeSCManCA23 July 2023Maybe I will be perceived as one of those insecure middle-aged men who is ""terrified"" of women, as labeled by another poster on here, but I assure you, I'm not.First of all, I'm gay, so I'm just here to provide a more unbiased and alternative look at the reality of what the world is nowadays when it comes to what I see between men and women. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I don't have s lot of straight friends and I've stood on the sidelines watching their lives play out quite often. And as I've offered my observations, I've had many a ""Barbie"" say, 'Yeah, I never thought of that,' when explaining how men think, and see things.Because remember as we move forward in this discussion, for every Barbie out there, there is a Ken too. And it would indeed be interesting to see the movie, ""Ken,"" come out next. And have it written by a man. And not a man who is just trying be progressive and accepted by women. But a man who truly will give Ken's side of the story too.So let's begin with the patriarchal thing. A deep and rather complex discussion to be sure.Is there still a patriarchal mentality going on in this world? Of course. And there will continue to be for some time to come. The world doesn't just do a 180 because some movie called Barbie comes out and relegates men to some sort of inconsequential joke.Nor did it immediately do a 180 just because women were becoming more vocal about their rights some 50+ years ago (even more when you consider the right to vote).Just because we're living in a time when it's more acceptable, and cool for women to take jabs at men, doesn't mean change will be enacted overnight. Especially in light of the fact that there are still women out there who aren't ""terrified"" (to use that poster's word) of men and are perfectly fine letting them take the lead in a relationship, protect them when necessary, and do the things that men have done in relationships since the beginning of time. Remember, patriarchal societies have been around since the beginning of time, and you can't blame men for doing what they ALSO have seen as being expected of them. Many of these expectations coming from women themselves. Whether they'll admit to it or not.For those who don't subscribe to the latter though, and want to become independent, and change that patriarchal trajectory, there are indeed alternatives. And I say, go for it. We're living in an age when women don't need men. They can be pretty much anything they want to be nowadays. Are there still ""ceilings"" to be shattered? Yes. But life really isn't that bad.And what about the Barbie body image thing. For decades we've heard women complain about that impossible image that Barbie dolls have set for women. But the reality is that most men don't expect that in a woman. Not nearly as much as women might pretend or believe they do. That's more of a socialized, media construct that comes as a result of what the Barbie doll, and more generally, Hollywood and print media have set up. In the day to day world though, that's not how it is when it comes to what men expect in women.Sure, men talk about good-looking women. They ogle women. Sometimes make a catcall or two. But women talk about good-looking men too. And when a good-looking man walks in the room, there is no denying what the women in the room think of him. Hell, I saw Aladdin on Broadway and when he came out without his shirt on, muscles bulging, the women in the audience went nuts. And in the play Take Me Out during the shower scene with a bunch of hot young men naked in the shower scene, the women in the audience weren't exactly suppressing their murmurings and ""responses."" So come on!And to expand upon that, I worked at a major amusement park in Anaheim for almost ten years when I was younger. I was witness to thousands of couples. And I can tell you that I actually saw more couples where the man was better looking than the woman than I did where the woman was better looking than the man.So no, men don't expect perfection.Actually, from the observations I've made of women it would suggest that they do place a lot of importance on looks and physique when it comes to a man too. They can pretend that they don't, and that it's the men who have these impossible expectations of women, but it doesn't change the facts.In the movie, we see Barbie's perspective on things. So, this is how Ken sees it in the real world too: women want a man who is good looking, has a great body, has a full head of hair. And oh yeah, if he has a lot of money, even better.And add to that you have women who have special interests such as a man in uniform;. Or a younger man. I have female friends who will only date a guy in uniform. Etc.So do women really want to play that ""expectations"" card?I wouldn't suggest it. Because they are just as guilty as men. And any body self-image thing that women have is more Hollywood, and yes, Barbie-driven than what is the reality anyway. Because men are way more accepting than women claim them to be. Or I should say, straight men are. Gay men, not so much.I will even add that men are so accepting of women, that ageism isn't even the issue that women play it up to be. Women complain about men who only want a younger, hotter woman and that women ""age out"" and are not treated with the same respect. To that I say bull. Let's say my 50 year old female friend and I go out for dinner, and our waiter is some hot younger man. If my friend has a thing for younger men and hits on him, depending on the moment in time, that friend of mine might very well have a date for the night.I can tell you that as a gay male, that would not happen with that younger man if he was gay. If he played on my team and I made a play for him, there would only be a 5-10% chance I would have a chance at him. Because if you want to know what picky is, ask a gay man. Younger gay men won't hardly give the time of day to an older man.So straight women benefit from this as well. There is no such thing as becoming too old. There are plenty of younger men who are willing and I'll bet where I'd have a 5-10% with the dude if he played on my team, she'd have an 80-90% chance with him if he was straight. Older gay men will not see the same willingness in younger gay men that straight women do in younger straight men. And even if the younger guy wasn't interested in an older woman, he would treat her with respect. The younger gay man will very likely put the older man down.But I digress. Even though proven the point that women have nothing to complain about. Trust me.In closing, are there Ken dolls who only want Barbie? Sure. But that's not the majority.Do men appreciate a good looking woman with a nice body? Yes.But women appreciate the same in men too, so time to move on from that discussion. Both men AND women have expectations of the opposite sex.As to the patriarchal thing? Definitely a deeper and more complex subject.But still, things have changed a lot for women. I know that patriarchal societies have been around for a long time. They have been the ""norm"" so to speak. And again, a lot of women are actually still okay with that. They don't mind the man taking the lead in ther relationship, protecting them, etc.But for those who don't subscribe to that, women can now be the VP of the USA, or the prime minister or president of whole countries. We almost had a female president here in the States. Women can be CEOs, and even directors of movies. Some of the wealthiest people on this earth are women. All kinds of opportunities.Even the opportunity to get your degree, get a nice job, and find a husband who has a lot of money, is totally hot, wears a uniform, is younger, or whatever. If the latter are your things too.Women have nothing to complain about. Looks, age, none of it matters as much as you think it does. For women, the Barbie syndrome may exist, but reality would suggest otherwise.Now boo hoo for me, all of that really DOES matter when you're gay. LOL. Or COL (cry out loud). Whatever the case may be.4 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5

"Tackles too much, ironic shadow of feminismkimryanrr23 July 2023The sets/costumes are the best part, and Ken (Ryan Gosling) delivers some memorable laughs and the most interesting character. The plot tried to take on too many themes it can't fully address and ends up feeling shallow. Themes include mortality, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, self worth, brainwashing, motherhood, relationships, stereotypes and on and on.Also, so many inconsistencies/loose ends. The Barbie's are sometimes robotic perfection and sometimes self actualized feminists. What happened to Skipper? Why did Barbie's human connection fall off the script once she meets Gloria (the human)? Does the dim witted male board act like nothing happened after all this? Also, the characters are very under utilized, I kept waiting for Alan to do something and Gloria felt so flat and predictable (and Will Ferrell's CEO and board is written as a shallow SNL skit that does not make the human world feel real at all, which cheapens Gloria's ""real"" female story). It really was all over the place, but did have some creative moments.Besides the irony of Ken standing out in a film against the patriarchy, it's hilarious that the main irony is Mattel absolutely winning a lucrative advertising campaign in a film against greedy capitalism! In the movie the male Mattel board is a ridiculous, money hungry machine, but in reality, the female makers of this film will profit millions alongside Mattel (ie- benefit from capitalism), and Mattel has many females on their real life board. I wish the film showed those females and how much women actually have accomplished in the real world and what we have overcome.6 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Such a bad moviefgarrido-9820219 July 2023I was expecting so much maybe.The only thing I like is when Ruth appears and we felt the connection mother daughter and when we used to play together.The cast was good but the movie so randomly weird, non sense, nothing you would expect from such a cool director.Visuals ok, but come on, it is such a waste of time and money.The argument gets totally lost, there is no line to follow up.Without Gosling or Robbie this movie would be one of the worst in history.Pretty interesting you can see all the barbie types, all the Ken too but to be honest, in our times we need more content. This movie only reminded me why is so hard to be a woman and perfection expected.179 out of 428 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

"Beautiful sets and constumes. Short attention span.input error23 July 2023After the sugar rush of the first impressions has subsided, I am left mostly with a memory of excessive preaching. A couple of touching moments make me not regret seeing it, but it is not going to be on my recommendations lists.Lots of fun gags, but they were all over the place and it left main story and main characters arcs bare without enough details to flesh them out.So a couple of monologues that were supposed to be a powerful highlight of the movie, ended up landing a bit flat.Tokenism seemed superficial, and as such once again more of a distraction from the main story.Beautiful moments of Barbie learning to cry that reminded me of the understated magic Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were able to create in their other works, but it was clearly not the style that matched well with the short attention span of this move.8 out of 14 found this helpful.

"The HYPE is not realsophiaaven26 July 2023It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is ""The Barbie"" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen't feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.62 out of 131 found this helpful.

"Overrated barbieametin-8625024 July 2023It's like a women's solidarity movie. It was a production in which all men were shown as 2nd class and this was done through a good cast and a well-established company. It's a totally overrated PR movie. Despite all this, the acting was successful. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. Ryan gosling and margot ronbbie are both good actors, but this scenario limited both of their abilities. In my opinion, product placement and advertisements were also over exaggerated. It was like the longest commercial I've ever seen in my life. I can say that I counted the minutes, especially for the last half hour of the movie to end, it was not a movie worth all this expectation.17 out of 28 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A Huge Generalization at Bestsuziejb-7938123 July 2023What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is: Everything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.I had a few laughs, but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction. It seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything. Wow, sounds like sexism to me. I'd prefer equality, which is something that we currently have.9 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2
"Colorful and educational, but weak plot renders it unexcitingnewgraexx27 July 2023I think a film has value if it entertains and/or educates.Barbie entertains with its bright and colorful sets,and its very humorous tongue-in-cheek jibes at patriachy and consumerism.It educates by colorfully and humorously depicting the dangers and folly of stereotyping and consumerist attitudes.To me, the above gives the film only mediocre value to the viewer because they are not accompanied by a strong plot.In other words, society is filled with many and various alternative films with exciting plots and the educational messaging, so why would a viewer bother with this plot-deficient film?Yes, Iknow the film's box office is huge (viewers did bother to see it), which prompts me to think that its reported $150m marketing spend was very effective. Thats what I call consumerism++.Special mention to Ryan Gosling - he's a natural in this film; he played the part very well.3 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Why did I waste my time?brocklawmurphy23 July 2023This movie was a massive let down. It was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face. I don't care about politics when I'm watching a movie, and I expect a well written story. This film is just bad, and I was actually interested in it. I had high expectations for this film and I think it did not deliver. It's not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life. Actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that I created an account just to leave a bad review. What did I even see in this film? It's a BARBIE MOVIE.31 out of 50 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"NOT family friendlyeRobb421 July 2023This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition. It's a clumsy attempt to paint people groups with a broad brush in order to win sympathy points for the main characters.The production was great, though. The music was stirring and heartfelt, and the visual presentation of the film was unique and enjoyable. The actors also brought movingly authentic performances. And there were some clever comedic moments that brought at least some relief to the suffocatingly heavy-handed onslaught of toxic messaging. It could've been a great movie.95 out of 165 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"Barbie in-depth reviewFaidel_24 July 2023It is undeniable that this film has done excellent marketing and the competition has only enhanced it. With a good cast and good direction, the film goes beyond what may appear or be implied.Clearly, if you go to see this movie you already have an idea of what to expect and what not to expect. However, it does not appeal to all audiences: regardless of the film's intended or interpreted approach, it is not for a child audience and goes beyond the Barbie audience; the film strays too far into different ideals, in some cases, somewhat exaggerated and from a somewhat hypocritical point of view, although they end up being relatively solved at the end of the film.Beyond that, the film is comical and entertaining, without becoming boring throughoust, although it is distinctive and ungainly, without being a positive thing in some specific apects.Barbie is made up of a great team that has done a great job to bring the film to the big screen and reach a lot of people, even though the audience that is really targeted and satisfied is very specific; it might not be the kind of movie you were expecting, not only because of its simple, unrealistic and somewhat absurd plot, but because of the path it takes towards the situation of the moment, represented in a way far from reality because of its absurdity and exaggeration in many aspects (this does not discredit the reality of the general idea of the film, but it does discredit the way it is conveyed).Having said that, the film is never boring, although it can be uncomfortable, absurd and, obviously, unrealistic. Within the limits of fiction, the general idea of the film is clear and understandable, although the plot can be improved and there are a couple of good and charismatic characters. If you are clear about what you are going for and keep in mind what I have said without disliking it, the film will not disappoint you.4 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Extremely disappointedgatvideosmkii22 July 2023I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well.10 out of 15 found this helpful.

"Uncomfortable watchgiang-taquynh23 July 2023The most political movie I have ever watched. It is so confusing that you can't be sure what its target audience is. It looks like they wanted it to be profound, but putting too much 'woke' content made it boring and cringe. As a woman, I honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beings.Overall, 4 for good acting, good music, and good costumes.I went to watch this movie as I heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep. I was curious. And I walked out of the cinema hall wishing that this movie was that simple as expected.8 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4
"Not what I was expecting...germandane22 July 2023I adored Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Margot Robbie was perfect as Barbie. (Parents, this is not a movie for little kids.) The beginning was hopeful and I loved the cast and the amazing set of Barbie Land. Barbie's playhouse was amazing! But as it went on, it became way too political and preachy and went downhill. If I did this movie, I would have made it a love story between Ken and Barbie and had them get married, making use of all the cool Barbie toys and her friends. But of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect, even though that's what most people still do these days. So it was a way cool set, amazing cast, but way too political for my taste.3 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5

"A big mess wrapped up in pink.ivonanejic23 July 2023The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can't wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can't decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might've been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.8 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4
"Not at all what I was expecting, walked out feeling sickolivercovey23 July 2023I get it it's a Barbie movie, but as a man in my early 20s going with his fiancé to see this movie, I walked out kind of feeling sick and just preached at the entire movie, don't get me wrong, I knew this was going to be a movie for the girls, but this movie had me feeling like just because I'm ""a man"" I'm abusive, ornery, controlling, etc. And made men out to be awful good for nothing's in every single story and every single male character in the movie, and I don't know about you guys but I believe in equality not reversed sexism.The movie definitely ended with some more heart and ended a little better than I expected it to, but I guess sometimes Hollywood just tries a little too hard.70 out of 154 found this helpful.

"A FILM THAT PEOPLE WILL NEVER FORGET, BUT SHOULD LEAVE IT BE.danielzhora24 July 2023Salute to the marketing department for creating a buzz like no other, hyping up a film based on what many girls want or dream to be, probably. 1 point for Margot Robbie who is perfect as a barbie-like character, perhaps better becoming the brand ambassador of the brand and stars in all their ads.The film, not sure who's their targeting, children to convey the heavy social issues they are trying to preach, or adults to watch this abomination-children-kind of for, apart from the abs of Ryan Gosling and/or Simu Liu that they keep showing, film. The film tried to be funny, 😑, but the real joke is when somebody think that this is a film worth wasting 2 hours of their life. Ridiculous.50 out of 90 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Deeply flawed coreNeutralWord26 July 2023Ambitious mess, its not a polished jewel without flaws.Can see this having true potential and understand people admiring the fearlessness more then the result and giving it a 10.Think you can go watch this if you expect it to be a 5 that is flawed and with a good mood you can still enjoy the experience. Go to it expecting a 10 and think your doomed.There is certainly things in this movie to enjoy indeed think it has to many ingredient. The acting of Ken and Barbie are great ironical they get to show off their range by literally barbie/ken.This site really need to lower the minimum review number of words as could have certainly made the same point with half the words, given the option.2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Worst movie I've seen in 30 years!katnangela25 July 2023If it were possible to rate this movie a negative 10 I would. Twenty five minutes in, and I was ready to walk out of the theater. It was without a doubt one of the silliest, most stupid movies I have ever seen in my life. It finally got a little better 30 minutes in, which brought it up to a negative three. Want an extreme waste of the talents of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. How did anyone ever convince them to star in this pink train wreck of a movie? Newsflash to Margo and Ryan, you're only as popular as your last movie! Lots of careers have gone into the toilet after a lousy movie like this one!16 out of 39 found this helpful.

"if you wanna go to the cinema choose oppenheimermandana-a21 July 2023It seemed like they wanted the barbie movie to be bigger like have this great big message for the audience, bring a whole lotta inspirational stuff but the plot was all over the place cause of all this preaching leading nowhere. Its comedy, tragic, musical, hopeful, inspirational and the list goes on just a mess of a rollercoaster. The preaching is just cringe and too much and when you think about it, it gets hypocritical. They wanted to fit so much into this movie but it didnt flow and work together, they didn't finish the ideas they started. No sort of development to be frank. Only good thing about this movie was Ryan gosling in his role of Ken, he carried the movie and did outstanding other than... dont waste money, energy, time like just dont go at all.64 out of 158 found this helpful.

"Failed trying to use nostalgia...joaoterry22 July 2023So much garbage. I don't get this movie at all. Let me explain myself. This is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this. What kind of audience was this movie made for? Doesn't look like it was made for kids, nor adults. Just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are. Who thought this would be a good idea? Same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately. Margo Robbie as Barbie? Some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia, like Mulan, the lion king or scooby doo to name a few. This one failed doing so.28 out of 76 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

Go se oppenheimer instead.maxilundholm26 July 2023Even though gosling gives ken such of a good play. This movie was to peachy. Really not good in my opinion but it was a good movie to sleep to. And my five year old daughter was so happy to see the movie and she loved the popcorn. And the ending was amazing to be a bad movie. I'd say the movie is good in the beginning but it's still badly written and the plot isn't good enough to make a movie like this one or something else that I think is better in that regard and it's not that good at the same level of story but it still makes it a great film to see and see and it is worth a watch and I don't know if.13 out of 29 found this helpful.

"Unfortunately, too much politicsgabrielddimitrov23 July 2023The comedy was ok at times. Otherwise, this movie has a modern political agenda, and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated. I understand the need for awareness of women's rights, possibilities, and freedom. It's here even in the 21st century, especially in some countries. However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous. Not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie, but more of a parody of a movie. I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but this piece is definitely overrated.19 out of 33 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"Genuinely disappointed and disgusted.cmzmsnw22 July 2023This movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly. It turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess. It wasnt funny or entertaining. Any hope for entertainment was lost immediately. Any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators. The fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me. Yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is, however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact. Instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie.14 out of 24 found this helpful.

"I'm a shallow writer in a preaching worldaussiefilmguy55623 July 2023The film started off in the Barbie world with beautiful cinematography and characters which came off as conveying childlike innocence and bombastic ideals. This innocence almost gave the sense of nostalgia for both men and women alike to a time and place that life was more simpler and about fun as a child.As the film progresses, a not so subtle and preachy message of the patriarch is constantly shoved down your throat in ways you cannot ignore it and continue on watching the film.The film attempts to deliver humor in a way that mocks gender and patriarchy norms but severely misses the mark and instead comes off as lacking intellect in its construction and concepts and at times weird attempts at humor such as Barbie telling the construction workers "" I don't have a Vagina and he doesn't have a penis"".The entirety of the film seems to be made in an attempt for teens and young children to be able to come and watch a deeply political and often sexualized film in a dumbed down mannerism for them to absorb its simplicity, but has backfired into a protest like rant down your throat and no room for enjoyment unless you hold similar views to the director.There was great potential for this film if it focused on great storytelling and character development as opposed to pushing the issues and political viewpoints of the director.Overall, a lost opportunity for something great.38 out of 88 found this helpful.

"Really disappointingrachaelparker-4517023 July 2023I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through.7 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"not goodjamustafa-2030126 July 2023Title: ""Barbie the Movie (2023): A Disastrous Attempt at Childhood Nostalgia""As a moviegoer who grew up in the '90s, I was excited to hear about the release of ""Barbie the Movie"" in 2023, hoping to relive some of the cherished memories from my childhood. However, my anticipation quickly turned into disappointment as I witnessed the abysmal spectacle that unfolded on the big screen. It is with great regret that I have to say that ""Barbie the Movie"" fails on almost every level, leaving audiences with an insipid and soulless film that tarnishes the legacy of the beloved doll.First and foremost, the plot is nothing short of a train wreck. The filmmakers seem to have thrown together a hodgepodge of ideas from various Barbie storylines without any coherence or logical progression. The story lacks depth and originality, resembling a half-baked amalgamation of clichés and poorly executed tropes. Characters are introduced haphazardly and underdeveloped, making it impossible to invest emotionally in their journey. The movie's attempt at incorporating a meaningful life lesson for young viewers is superficial and forced, further adding to the sense of disconnected storytelling.Despite advancements in animation technology, the visual aspects of ""Barbie the Movie"" are utterly lackluster. The character designs, while attempting to modernize Barbie's appearance, end up feeling awkward and lifeless. The vibrant world of Barbie, which has always been a highlight of the doll's appeal, is rendered in a way that lacks imagination and fails to capture the enchanting charm that Barbie's universe should exude. It's evident that the filmmakers prioritized commercial viability over artistic integrity, leading to a generic and forgettable visual experience.The voice acting in the film is another major letdown. Instead of enlisting talented and experienced voice actors, the studio seems to have opted for A-list celebrities who lend their voices to the iconic characters. However, the performances lack sincerity and authenticity, with the actors sounding disinterested and disengaged throughout the movie. This casting choice backfires, as the celebrity voices overshadow the essence of the characters they portray, making it challenging to connect with them on any level.Moreover, ""Barbie the Movie"" shamelessly indulges in product placements and corporate tie-ins. Rather than focusing on crafting a compelling narrative, the film becomes an unabashed marketing tool, attempting to push Barbie merchandise onto the audience. Such blatant commercialization not only detracts from the viewing experience but also feels exploitative of the nostalgic feelings that many viewers may have for the iconic doll.The film's attempts at humor also fall flat, relying on tired and predictable jokes that fail to elicit even a chuckle. The lack of wit or cleverness in the script makes the movie feel like a slog, and one can't help but wonder if the writers put any effort into crafting genuinely amusing dialogue.As if all these issues weren't enough, ""Barbie the Movie"" also suffers from pacing problems. Scenes drag on for what seems like an eternity, while others are rushed without proper development. The result is an uneven and disjointed film that fails to maintain any semblance of engagement, leaving the audience bored and disinterested.In conclusion, ""Barbie the Movie"" (2023) is an unmitigated disaster that squanders the potential of a beloved childhood icon. The film's lackluster plot, underwhelming animation, subpar voice acting, shameless commercialization, and uninspired humor culminate in a movie that is an insult to the timeless character of Barbie. As a nostalgic trip down memory lane, this film misses the mark by a long shot, leaving both children and adults alike yearning for the magic that the Barbie brand once held. Save your time and money, and avoid this regrettable cinematic misadventure.22 out of 50 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"I tried but I can'trangxrang21 July 2023I did have a very high expectation for this movie but.. Sorry it was the worst movie I've ever watched. I tried to find the message from this movie but I couldn't. It seems like it tried to send a message move our hearts but it wasn't delivered to audiences. Because I have no idea what exactly they wanted to make. So what did they really want to make? Musical film? Comedy? Touching stories? Girls can do anything? Or just colorful cute movies? They mixed it all and added it all so the movie became just lame and cloudy.. I hoped the movie just could be more kitschy, tacky, easy, unrealistically happy and funny like 90s, 2000s movies.I just felt sorry for Ryan Gosling and other actors and actresses.47 out of 124 found this helpful.

"Out of controljlnewps26 July 2023I thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself. Most scenes last 1-2 minutes too long and the ending is terrible. No resolve was ever made to the story which leaves. We have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good, but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before. Politics aside, this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess. One positive is the set design and costumes were amazing. The actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown, but most jokes are over used or just fall flat.8 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Why do people seem to enjoy this?Leske420 July 2023The first part of the movie and all the other scenes set in Barbie-land were a huge sensory overload for me. Everything is violently colorful, things happen super fast and everyone is screaming in a strange voice while trying to outscream each other. This Barbie-land is supposed to be a super joyful place but honestly it just made me nauseous. At this point I was praying for it to be over and had a really hard time following what's going on.It gets better when they arrive in the real word, but I seriously don't get why people call it ""deep"" and ""philosophical"" because most of the dialouge is cliché at best and at times it's absolute cringe. It tries real hard to deal with serious topics but keeps explaining things like you're a 5-year-old.Emotions are also portrayed a super weird way in this movie (I guess because we're dealing with dolls, but still, sometimes this level of over-acting just hurts to watch), and a lot of things happen randomly without any explanation. It's also not for (small) kids. There were a lot of really small kids in the cinema when I went and most of them were super confused with some even crying, it was clear they couldn't really follow the plot and didn't get most of the supposed jokes.140 out of 350 found this helpful.

Ken plays a role but it's overly complicated and annoying don't really know how this is rated as a good movie.

"Bad Bad Barbiejustinlesteraz23 July 2023This was really bad and boring. Very pandering and toxic feminine and it should have been about equality. Barbie is just not what I expected it to be. I would like if it was better and that people would save their money. Not worth it trust me, I cannot recommend.While the sets were decent, I was hoping it would end and be over soon and then I looked at my watch there was still an entire hour left.I thought about leaving and sneaking into Oppenheimer instead but alas I was with my family and they would have noticed. Just absolutely boring for both kids and adults, it should have been more about the fun Barbie Land and not so dramatic.Overall, cringe as hell and just boring while missing the mark. Men and women are equal and that is that.Good night.22 out of 59 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1

The point wasn't really well made, in fact it mostly ended up being corny and worn-out. I really found it hard to sit through the whole movie, especially the ending scenes, I just wanted it to finally be over.

"Super Cringe, Poor scriptaizaz-7852723 July 2023Barbie: A Rollercoaster of EmotionsIn the vast cinematic universe, every now and then we stumble upon movies that leave us perplexed. The recent entrant to this league is the film ""Barbie."" Now, while one might naturally expect whimsical magic, tales of transformation, or inspirational stories from a Barbie-themed narrative, this movie takes an entirely different turn.The film starts with a ""wow"" moment, and by that, I mean it does capture attention. Vibrant colors, meticulous animation, and that pristine, Barbie-esque world build an immediate intrigue. It's almost as if you're handed a glossy magazine and can't wait to flip through the pages.Soon enough, laughter echoes, thanks to a series of light-hearted and sometimes slapstick comedic scenes. ""Hahahaha,"" goes the audience, and you find yourself laughing along. The humor is akin to what you'd find in classic cartoons where situations spiral out of control in the most unpredictable manner. But then, unpredictability isn't a constant in this movie, as we soon discover.As the plot progresses, the jokes transition from being genuinely funny to being cringe-worthy. One cannot help but feel that the writers might have been trying a tad bit too hard to maintain the film's comedic momentum. The dialogue, the character interactions, the situations - everything starts to reek of cliches that most of us have outgrown. It's akin to that feeling when someone stretches a joke far beyond its elastic limit - it snaps.""Super cringe"" is an apt descriptor for the midpoint of the movie. It's as though the film decided to try on every trope in the book. At this juncture, I found myself torn between wanting to continue watching out of sheer curiosity or to flee and save myself further second-hand embarrassment. It's the cinematic equivalent of a car crash - you can't help but watch, even if through the gaps in your fingers.The descent into ""ewww"" territory is swift. The choices made by characters, the overdone scenes, and some seemingly unnecessary dramatic moments make one question the very essence of the storyline. Is this still a Barbie movie or a parody of itself?Just when you're on the brink of giving up, the movie surprises with a ""serious speech."" This soliloquy feels out of place, like an oasis in a desert. The emotional weight behind the words and the depth it brings is commendable. It's as if the movie momentarily redeems itself, reminding us of the values and the principles that Barbie, as a brand, has stood for over the years.But before one can dwell on this profound moment, the movie hurries towards ""the end."" The conclusion, or lack thereof, is a testament to the film's erratic narrative journey. It's disjointed, abrupt, and leaves more questions than answers.In summation, ""Barbie"" is predictably unpredictable. From the promising start to the descent into a muddled mess, the movie is an enigma. The storyline's trajectory is confusing, and it's evident that there was a lack of clear direction in what the writer was trying to convey. The film lacks a proper ending and leaves viewers in a lurch, desperately trying to piece together the filmmaker's intent.For ardent Barbie fans, this might be a disappointment. For those looking for something unconventional (albeit chaotically so), it might be worth a watch. One thing is certain, though: this film is bound to spark conversations, be it about its brilliance or its sheer audacity. But as the age-old adage goes - any publicity is good publicity. And ""Barbie"" sure has got everyone talking.71 out of 166 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"It's good for an evening with popcorn in front of the TVpetrxpp23 July 2023Going to the cinema is a waste of money if you just not want only watch Margot. Barbie certainly had the potential for an original and fresh adventure musical, but alas. Unfortunately, even well-chosen actors, well-written songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenario.A mess of banal clichés and a completely wasted opportunity. With such a budget, a cast and an interesting iconic toy, it should have been handled better.The film has a very interesting and brisk first half, but from the second it drags on at a disgusting pace.Even worse is the completely inappropriate, overblown and absurd push towards feminism.3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"As heavy handed as a movie can bejackgdemoss27 July 2023Barbie was a huge surprise in both a positive and negative way. On the upside, I was not expecting as many solid comedy moments and stellar performances by Gosling and Robbie. I was expecting the PG-13 rating to be a bit more for show but it is used to good comedic effect on a number of occasions.The biggest surprise was how effective the marketing team behind this film was. They were not only able to elevate initial hype by tying themselves to a Nolan film, but they were also able to completely disguise what the film was about. Trailers would lead you to believe this will be a fun-loving comedy with some character moments, some heart, and a lot of nostalgia. Instead, Barbie's central theme and main plot revolve around the least nuanced take on feminism I have seen to date. I would not be surprised if this script was made by having a 10 year old girl describe the basics of patriachry to an AI, specify that it should make an over-exaggerated mean spirited narrative from it, and then have some of the most unintelligent writers in hollywood tack on a monologue for the human character at the end. That final monologue by the mother is one of the most insufferable things I have experienced in a movie theater.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3
"One word to sum up this movie : Easy.Lukrash25 July 2023I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Great cast, great global hype, and the feeling that it wants to go further than just a ""girly"" Barbie movie.As a matter of fact, I was quite disappointed. While the message that is carried in this film is really important, I think that it was just to easy. It only talked about things we already knew, and not in a subtile or in a new way. I think it could have been so much more interesting and impactful. The scenario is also easy, you already know how it is going to end in the first 15 minutes. No surprises.Nevertheless, I must mention the great cast, costumes, sets and music. But in the end, it's just a colorful feel-good movie, that is empty inside. Mid. 5.2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"very good movie, very entertaininggehete-4094924 July 2023Barbie is one of the best movies that has come out in recent history. It has great casting, great story, great acting, great music. It is a movie about being a strong female role model and having belief in yourself. Margot robbie is gorgeous, Ryan Gosling is funny and all the side characters do an excellent job at contributing getting very positive messages across.I cried several times and laughed at every joke because it all worked wonderfully. I wish people would make more of these movies as they really make the world a better place. There is not one thing bad about this movie.

"Worst movie everdeveshkedia-4604324 July 2023I have to express my disappointment with this movie, as it is riddled with an overwhelming number of loopholes and plot holes that hinder the overall viewing experience. It's quite disheartening to find that there is a noticeable absence of a compelling and engaging story, leaving the audience wanting more substance and coherence.Frankly, I cannot help but think that investing time in watching this film is not the best use of one's entertainment hours. Instead, I would suggest diverting attention to purchasing a Barbie doll, allowing for a more enjoyable and imaginative playtime experience.In conclusion, I find it regrettable that this movie fails to live up to expectations, and I consider it to be an utter waste of valuable time and cinematic potential.33 out of 72 found this helpful.

"cute but boringpzcxfbnh26 July 2023Whenever someone says they disliked the movie most people tell them it's because they are not getting the plot correctly or they simply don't get feminism. I am a girl and a feminist and this movie was all marketing, ik i'm not saying something new. It was a cute story but half of the dialogues were bad/kinda cringy. Also, many relationships were presented to us, for example the mom and her daughter, and the movie never bothered to show us a little backstory, it had potential. At least I really appreciated that the main purpose of the movie was to show women everyday struggles, loved the monologue.I think it's a nice movie, but not worth the hype like to watch it in the cinema.2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Having a character yell at you for two minutes about how hard being a woman is isn't creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 1.But I still did love the movie. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. The sets, the costumes, the small jokes were all so wonderful. The Barbie world feels totally separate and complete. Ryan Gosling was really the star of the movie for me. Every moment he was on screen I loved it. The moments I didn't love, were really hard to get through. I loved the take of Barbieland being a total matriarchy, but I really didn't need to be beaten over the head with a stick for two minutes to get the point they were trying to make.2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Great potential ruind by poiticising everythingjitudaimari23 July 2023Great costumes and set, but the Barbie land was not fully exposed instead they chose to make every single scene in the movie a political stand. After half an hour is stared to feel like ever other generic Hollywood movies. Everyone in the movie theatre was trying so hard to enjoy the movie, but all there expectations were crushed. No one laughed at the supposedly funny scenes. It was a dread. Dude people go to a Barbie movie to have fun, we have social media to preach about political issues everyday. Everyone fighting for every minute sign of offensive remarks. News anchors and politicians virtue signalling. Where will people go to have fun, Hollywood deserve to go broke.41 out of 95 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Advertising Campaignkeithlinstead27 July 2023I take it the sales of Barbie and Ken have plummeted over the last few years. This isn't a movie, it's an advertising campaign. Fair play to all involved, the movie actors and producers and the manufacturer will make a fortune. But as a movie, this is utter garbage, no real substance to the plot and the way the film has been written is a shambles. If the writers are on strike in Hollywood we should all be grateful for the respite. Hopefully whilst they are on strike they can come up with some substantial plots and decent writing. When the unjustified hype calms down this will be remembered for being awful.3 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Not impressedpdcqsq21 July 2023While there were definitely some funny parts, they were too few to outweigh the other annoyingly cheesy jokes thrown around. The actors seemed a bit on the older side but the overall movie did not appear to be an ""adult movie"". I feel that it tried to find a balance for kids and adults but in the end fell short for both. Some bits were too long for my taste and the plot seemed to go back and forth too much between the Barbie and the real world. I did not have high expectations but what did help me watch through the movie were the strong messages for our generation that were heartfelt and genuine.41 out of 110 found this helpful.

"Terribly overrated claptrap.markgorman28 July 2023In which Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach recycle their failed 30 minute Black Mirror idea and pad it out to a full two hour shaggy dog tale, of little or no consequence, whilst breaking the hearts of nine year old girls worldwide who flock in their millions to a movie that flies straight over their heads.To be fair the first three minutes are awesome when they pastiche 2001 A Space Odyssey (but we'd already seen it in the trailer). And Margot Robbie is breathtakingly beautiful from start to finish.Ryan Gosling's faye Ken is, by contrast, just a bit annoying, (and to be fair, so is Robbie) but neither are as gratingly garbage as Will Ferrell and his bunch of Mattel men.Other highlights include Billie Eillish's stunningly gorgeous closing music which gets all existential on us.The design is, to a point, quite fun but not consistently so and the morale of the story, or the political polemic about equal rights for women, does not fail to land, although it does so in a Groundhog sort of manner.This is not a good movie. Gerwig, Baumback, Robbie and Gosling have all done significantly superior work. This is quite simply a bunch of talented people having a laugh and getting away with it.Hats of to Mattel for allowing a lot of self deprecation on their part and to the profits it will have raised for their mighty corpioration.But is this good cinema? No, it is not.1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"Corny, Watchable, But So Cornyjonkelley-8163623 July 2023This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Very tedious.AndyLianB28 July 2023I went in the cinema optimistic as the trailer looks really good, comedy, entertaining. But the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film, the rest I never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time, The film didn't make any sense what so ever, besides from the first 30 minutes & the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophe.I have to praise Margot Robbie for her performance, despite the deplorable storyline, her acting was outstanding. On the other hand Ryan Gosling's acting/performance was cheap, cheesy, & overall cringeworthy. A massive shout out to Kate McKinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny, I love her originality.Overall not for me, as the storyline is atrociously written & didn't make sense.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Felt like a hallmark moviemowrylaura25 July 2023This movie should have been for free and on the hallmark channel. So sappy, and preachy. It felt like it was trying too hard to get the message across when it could have been orchestrated better. Also all this hype and getting people to wear pink and excited for Barbie movie when the movie itself was completely opposite of the original Barbie. Like we get it, women have insecurities blah blah blah. We all know this. You didn't make us realize this in the movie. Idk in my opinion not worth spending your money to go watch this movie, just wait for it to go on Netflix and watch it at home!!!!!!!!17 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Faberge egg movie of the summerpcccflores26 July 2023This movie has great visuals, and the clothes Barbie wears take me back to my childhood especially the barbie house! Unfortunately, this movie reminds me of a Faberge egg so nice on the outside and beautiful to look at, but there isn't much to see on the inside in this case. Such a waste of millions of dollars that went into this film, but yet there is only a nice beginning, and the rest of the movie is just filled with long dialogue, preachy preach lines that go on into tangents, and they make look guys look super dumb in this film which is messed up lol. I think I like the barbie doll and ken batter in toy story haha. By the way this movie is not for little ones! It will go over their heads LOL.14 out of 34 found this helpful.

"So much potentialjonketchum29 July 2023I wanted to see this movie since the set pictures got leaked. Once they released the trailer and the clips, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.It started off great. It was hilarious. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were amazing. Then the actual comedy stopped. Jokes fell flat. The ""Barbie world"" they set up then just ignored the toy universe they spent 20 minutes setting up to put forth terrible gags and a preachy message that made no sense. For instance, Barbie could only bend certain ways in the beginning, then she can bend her body like a normal human, then she can't again for one joke, then she can again. It was awful.Normally, Will Ferrell is at least a little bit humorous. Even he was dry. The best part was a fake commercial halfway through it. I've wanted to get up and walk out so bad. I felt like it was also geared towards everyone in the beginning, and then adults in the last 75 minutes. It became too dramatic and preachy.The Lego movie managed to be geared toward the family and still gave a good message in the last few minutes. That should have been the route this took.2 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"From Hype to RealityKallimachos726 July 2023I would like to start by saying that Ryan Gosling delivers an impressive performance as Ken, truly standing out in the film with his remarkable portrayal. However, the movie doesn't quite meet the marketed expectations, opting for a more adult, satirical, and meta-commentary approach instead of the anticipated lighthearted comedy, which may make it less enjoyable for some who were expecting different things . The visuals and humor can be excessive at times, possibly detracting from the overall experience. Additionally, the movie's direct handling of its message , while thought-provoking, might polarize viewers.20 out of 52 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1
"Disappointingkirbyirish-7853522 July 2023Had so much more potential. This script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel. Although Margot Robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well, it's not enough to carry this movie alone. Ryan Gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment, especially during the first half of the film. Not the worst movie of the year but not the best of it's release week either.Overall feeling is Gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point. I am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs. Ultimately they tried to be a little too deep, muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way.2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"Such a lagpratyprat23 July 2023This movie is about women and how they are suppressed in the real world. The concept is good but the way they portrayed it is straight up boring in the film. Greta gerwig did not live up to her full potential while making this film. The first half of the film was fun and had a bit of humour . Anything after the first half was just a stretch. Anyone going to watch the movie in the theatre I would suggest you guys not go just wait for the ott release. If someone even wants to go ,go for the hype not to expect anything from it . Well only reason I even gave a four star was because i can't imagine anyone else playing the role of barbie and ken( Margot robbie and Ryan Gosling) they were great.3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Nothing but a good picturevriskasuper23 July 2023To tell the truth, I expected the film to be something more than a beautiful picture with good actors and some funny comedy pieces. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Kate McKinnon: they all are my favourite actors. That was actually the reason to buy a ticket. But the film did really disappointed me.I liked the costumes and decorations, the topic of feminism, some jokes and musicals...but the way it was used is pretty confusing.First of all, the topic of feminism could have been described more... natural? Not just a woman telling other women that they are more than just servants for their men. It's true. But... really? Just men's riot, crying women and yes finally the thought of feminism. It's so trite. And it's all just for about...five minutes??? You took more time for these musical pieces that meant nothing but a waste of time. You should have used the screen time not for silly men running around the office or people dancing around good decorations, but for talking about the real point of the film (men and women: their life can be really good even without each other, because all of them are independent creatures. Women are strong and can be everyone they want as well as men do).As for me, the film could have been more structured. It seems like the first thought a person got in the morning and wrote everything that was in the head. It doesn't work like that. You don't have any structure in your film, except for plot. You use some strange moments with dancing people or a crazy riding car like in forza horizon, but for what? Is it a blockbuster or musical? These are good and I love musicals and blockbusters moments, but when they are really useful in the case they are used in, but in the film I didn't see the point of these ""juicy moments"".For me...it was the toy story, but with Barbie and the worst not structured subsequence of actions. Sorry but you had some of the best actors, the topic of feminism, good decorations... and just made the film thoughtless.15 out of 44 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"So political and weird humorrayannacape23 July 2023This film had so much to yet fell so flat.First off, the humor felt so cheesy and dumb. It didnt fit well together and often (mostly) missed the mark. It started weird, got better then NOPE! Flat. Over and over again.The flow of the plot, also, had so many great things yet was carried out in such a strange flow. Started great then strange, goes great then strange, etc., on and on again.Yet, the thing that truly sucked was the ultra feminism-> It made all men weak and stupid, and that is just wrong. Women are strong and powerful, but men do not need to be so degraded to see it. Women shine on our own. Masculinity is great, and WOMEN are great. Together they are wonderful. Woman are strong, and men aren't the problem. Hate and being a jerk is the problem.But, the good- the relationship between Barbie and Gloria! It was so sweet. Still ultra feminist but so so sweet.AND WEIRD BARBIE is awesome. She's so weird and every girl ever loved their weird Barbie. I sure did.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Wish I would've seen Oppenheimerkayleepinkert23 July 2023It's true, any other movie would've been better.I was really looking forward to seeing Barbie! Thought it would be more fun & bring back a lot of childhood memories. I was expecting a light and airy movie.However, the message was disappointing to me. I also found myself looking at the time hoping it would be over soon. They preached that this movie was for ""everyone"" & am so thankful that there weren't any children in the theater when I saw it because I do not think it was appropriate for younger aged kiddos.Will still always love Barbie & Margot Robbie just wish this would've been better!14 out of 40 found this helpful.

"Taking down the human thinking standardsrahulpoonia-5589723 July 2023Barbie is not carrying any knowledgeable and intelligent thing but carrying a lot of pink color.Movie shows anything but the talent of a director, writer, actor, actress.This shows which kind of knowledge and information standard we are passing to our next generation.Just for the sake of upcoming generation we should not create a legacy in the entertainment industry like 'Barbie'.Honestly this movie is a total reflection of comic fantasy nothing to do with the logic and the reality.Entertainment is not only about showing pink color this should be carry something valuable and the women's suffering as Barbie is trying to depict is already treated so we have to move to the next level and should try to depict more deepen level women suffering besides the body shaming thing because most of the world have been overcome this type of mentality already.16 out of 56 found this helpful.

"Hilarious with not very well thought out feminist philosophy.mabusrd22 July 2023I'll preface by saying the movie is hilarious, has a ton of iconic moments, and is definitely worth the watch.But, this is a big BUT, as a woman I think it fell flat in its feminist ideas.It basically, as usual, defined womanhood by motherhood which is a critical pitfall in my opinion, especially with a prominent cast member being a trans woman - making it a pristine opportunity to at least add a single line about women stepping away from the mother's role, and how it doesn't define our femininity or us as women.The movie also failed in showing the negative effects of patriarchy on men themselves.And while its plot contained a revolution it ended with a return to status quo, as usual for Hollywood, can't change, eh?It had a very good premise to show the negatives of both matriarchy and patriarchy, and choose to present what true equality might look like, but chose not to.It made the entire message fall flat. And since this philosophy played a big role in the plot itself, I feel like it was very disappointing.1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5

The movie tried so hard to make a point yet still failed.The cast was amazing but the plot didn't do much I see how the writers tried to make the movie show us the double standards when it comes to woman rights but honestly they did such a bad job at that. I really hoped this movie would actually be as meaningful as the writers intended it to be but it was just a very bad comedy.a very bad representation of woman and just overall a bad movie.It could be fun for passing time and for girls night, but don't expect to be amazed by it.cause you will be disappointed.3 out of 10 found this helpful.

"Barbie-not goodthongman22 July 2023The only reason this movie even gets a 2 from me is because Margot Robbie is a beautiful woman. It's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. A waste of money to see. Will Ferrell plays his usual ridiculous self as all of his roles. Ryan Gosling also has a role that is beneath him. Margot Robbie is a great actress and so much more capable than this role. A definite don't see this movie. It should have an age rating no one over the age of eight years old allowed unless accompanied by a toddler. Yes, it was that bad. An embarrassment to all who acted in this movie. The writers should be ashamed. This may be all that Hollywood is capable of during a writers strike. Hopefully there will not be a sequel to this God awful movie. I only saw it because my wife wanted to see it for some strange reason. I would have to say it's the worst movie I have ever paid to see hands down. So not waste your time or your money to go to this movie. Wait for it to go to video. It shouldn't take long.5 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2
"Feminism but the rest?iyaseminkose23 July 2023I'm NOT a Barbie girl in NOT the Barbie World, Life in plastic, It's NOT fantastic. In the beginning of the film, it can be thought that will go nice way with a good end and a powerful message. There is so much effort in the beginning, like building a strong idea, however this is disappered in the final. And this is such a disappointment that the film does nothing about giving an idea about liberal feminism because there is always managers as boys or girls. I think the film's main idea should be every human being no matter it is a boy or a girl can be everything they want and can be handle every situation as a human. It is ridiculous to discuss this as ""being a man or a woman"" in the 2023. In the Barbie world or in the real world it should be out of date. The final should be reviewed with this manner cause the expactation was very high with this huge-budget film...1 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5
"Great sets, great execution but horrible storylineDaHermitKid28 July 2023Firstly, the technical execution is top notch. Great attention to detail both costume and sets.Ryan Gosling is by far the the best and delivers an excellent performance as the foolish Ken. The others do a good job as well.But this movie's overall messaging is horrible. It paints an entire group of people (the Kens) as purposeless and existing only to serve the superior Barbies. Plus, any movie that unironically talks about ""the patriarchy"" is automatically cringe. Parents with children especially boys should think hard about what message they are sending their kids when they see this movie.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The production and crew could have done a lot more with this movie to draw more attention. Like again I said in the title waste of time. With also not adding enough in the movie they have also tried too much on the set and dressing designs, but the cast for the movie was okay with me but instead of Ryan gosling as Ken Freddy Prinze Jr. Instead. With this movie I feel sad that production made this movie PG-13. Because the age group of people that lobve barbie are 5-9 year Olds. But parents can take their children to see babies but kids will not find it exciting with all of the adult jokes and references.0 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?
